Stéphane Auguste Ernest N. Demol (born 11 March 1966) is a Belgian retired footballer who played as a central defender.
He amassed Belgian Pro League totals of 120 games and 11 goals over the course of seven seasons, mainly with Anderlecht and Standard Liège with which he won eight major titles combined. He also competed professionally in Italy, Portugal, France, Greece and Switzerland.
Demol represented Belgium in two World Cups. In 2000 he started a managerial career, going on to work in several countries.
Born in Watermael-Boitsfort, Brussels, Demol joined local R.S.C. Anderlecht's youth system at the age of 14, moving to the first-team setup four years later and scoring four league goals in just 17 matches in his first full professional season, as the capital side renewed its domestic supremacy.
Demol soon became noticed by several clubs abroad, moving to Italy for Bologna FC, but his breakthrough would arrive the following year, in Portugal with F.C. Porto: he scored an astonishing 11 first division goals, and helped his team win the national championship.
Demol moved countries again after just one year, now signing with French side Toulouse FC, but he returned in late 1991 to his country after joining Standard Liège, where he helped to consecutive UEFA Cup qualifications, finishing second to Anderlecht in his second year.
Aged 27, Demol signed with Cercle Brugge KSV, but did not receive regular playing time. He subsequently returned for another abroad spell, being equally unsuccessful for S.C. Braga, Panionios GSS, FC Lugano and Sporting Toulon Var (the latter in the French second division).
Demol ended his career in 2000 at 34, after playing one year apiece with FC Denderleeuw and amateurs SK Halle, in which he began his manager career. In 2005, after several brief head coaching spells, he became assistant manager at former club Standard Liège, helping it to another runner-up position, trailing, once again, Anderlecht.
On 2 November 2009, Demol quit R. Charleroi S.C. due to poor results. On 15 February 2012, he was appointed at FC Brussels.
Demol played 38 matches for the Belgian national team and scored one goal, heading home in the round-of-16 clash against the Soviet Union at the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico (4–3 after extra time).
In 2006, his good friend and ex-teammate René Vandereycken became the Red Devils' coach, and he invited Demol to become its assistant manager. He left the post two years later, returning to club action.
