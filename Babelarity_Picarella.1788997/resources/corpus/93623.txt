The Muroidea are a large superfamily of rodents, including hamsters, gerbils, true mice and rats, and many other relatives. They occupy a vast variety of habitats on every continent except Antarctica. Some authorities have placed all members of this group into a single family, Muridae, due to difficulties in determining how the subfamilies are related to one another. The following taxonomy is based on recent well-supported molecular phylogenies.
The muroids are classified in six families, 19 subfamilies, around 280 genera, and at least 1300 species.
Family Platacanthomyidae (spiny dormouse and pygmy dormice)
Family Spalacidae fossorial muroids
Subfamily Myospalacinae (zokors)
Subfamily Rhizomyinae (bamboo rats and root rats)
