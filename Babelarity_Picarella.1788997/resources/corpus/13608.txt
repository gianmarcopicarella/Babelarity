Gertjan Verbeek (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈɣɛrcɑn vərˈbeːk], born 1 August 1962) is a retired Dutch footballer who is currently managing VfL Bochum.
After retiring from his playing career in 1994, Verbeek stayed with SC Heerenveen as an assistant-coach. He left for Heracles Almelo in 2001, and after a successful stint there was hired as the successor to Foppe de Haan with SC Heerenveen. In 2008 he was hired by Feyenoord, but was fired after clashing with players a few months into his tenure. He moved to Heracles Almelo for the 2009–2010 season, and after guiding them to a 6th-place finish in the Eredivisie, AZ hired him for the 2010–2011 season. Verbeek caused controversy in December 2011 in a 2011–12 KNVB Cup match against Ajax by leading AZ off the pitch in protest at having their goalkeeper Esteban Alvarado sent off for retaliating against a pitch invader. The game was consequently abandoned. On 29 September 2013 AZ fired him due to lack of chemistry with the players.
The German football club 1. FC Nürnberg hired him on 22 October 2013, giving him the first coaching opportunity outside of Netherlands, with a contract until 30 June 2015. However, he was sacked on 23 April 2014. On 22 December 2014 the VfL Bochum announced signing Verbeek as head coach, starting 1 January 2015. In his return to Nuremberg on 23 March 2015, Bochum defeated 1. FC Nürnberg 2–1.
