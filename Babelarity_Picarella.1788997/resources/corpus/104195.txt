The youngest enlisted soldier to serve in the Confederate Army was David Bailey Freeman from Ellijay. He enlisted in Company D 6th Georgia Cavalry with his brother on May 16, 1862 just two weeks before his 11th birthday. He was known as Little Dave and fought not as a musician or messenger but as an actual soldier. He fought at Chickamauga and during the Atlanta Campaign among other places.
Gilmer County was in no way left out of the war. The rough terrain of the North Georgia mountains made a "hideout" for Pro-Union men, Confederate deserters, and men avoiding being conscripted into military service. The state of Georgia fought back against these men by organizing Confederate Home Guard Units.
In 1864 there was an attempt to organize a pro union guerrilla force made up of these men in the mountains, called the 1st Georgia Infantry (US). They were equipped with weapons and supplies. They also stole horses and mules from Pro-Confederate families just as the Home Guard stole from the Pro-Union families. As a condition of their enlistment these men had only agreed to serve in Georgia. As a result, the unit was never recognized by the Federal Government.
On November 5, 1864 the 1st Georgia Infantry (US) went on a raid into Gilmer County near Bucktown to steal horses and mules. Here they met the Confederate Home Guard and the Battle of Bucktown ensued. Twenty-one of the union guerrillas were captured and several others were wounded and killed. In possession of the captured was a list of names of local supporters. Several of the captured turned out to be Confederate deserters who were executed in Gainesville on November 7.
The war would leave deep scars on Gilmer County for years after the war.
