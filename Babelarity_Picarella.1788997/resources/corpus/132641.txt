The Roman Catholic Diocese of Tulsa (Latin: Dioecesis Tulsensis) is a particular church of the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church in the eastern region of the U.S. state of Oklahoma. Its ecclesiastical territory includes all of 31 counties in eastern Oklahoma, including the most populous county of the group, Tulsa County. The resignation of Bishop Edward James Slattery was accepted on May 13, 2016, and David Konderla named his successor.
Before the diocese was established, it was part of the former Diocese of Oklahoma City-Tulsa, which had been founded in 1905. The Catholic Church in Oklahoma was founded by French Benedictine monks who entered Indian Territory in 1875. St Gregory's Abbey in Shawnee owes its origins to those same Frenchmen.
The Diocese of Tulsa was founded on December 13, 1972, following the division of the former Diocese of Oklahoma City-Tulsa. At present, there are a total of 78 parishes (including mission churches) in the 26,417 square miles (68,420 km2) of the diocese. The official news and information publication of the diocese is The Eastern Oklahoma Catholic.
