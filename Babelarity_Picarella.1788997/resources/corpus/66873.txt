The Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, Ltd. (Comac) is a Chinese state-owned aerospace manufacturer established on 11 May 2008 in Shanghai, China. The company has a registered capital of RMB 19 billion (US$2.7 billion as of May 2008). The government-owned corporation is a designer and constructor of large passenger aircraft capacities of over 150 passengers, in an effort aimed at reducing China's dependency on Boeing and Airbus.
The first jet to be marketed is the ARJ21 developed by AVIC I, which will be followed by the C919 planned for release in 2016. The company head office is in Pudong, Shanghai.
The C919, which can seat up to 168 passengers, is meant to compete in the market for single-aisle jets dominated by Airbus Industrie's A320 and Boeing Co.'s 737.
Comac, Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, was established on 11 May 2008 in Shanghai. It was established jointly by Aviation Industry Corporation of China, Aluminum Corporation of China, Baosteel Group Corporation, Sinochem Group, Shanghai Guosheng Corporation Limited, and State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission.
For all models sold beginning with the Comac C919, COMAC's naming system for commercial airliners has taken the form of 9X9.
On 24 March 2011, Comac and Bombardier Inc. signed a framework agreement for a long-term strategic cooperation on commercial aircraft. The intention is to break the near-duopoly of Airbus and Boeing.
Products included in the programme include:
Bombardier CRJ-series

On September 23, 2015, Boeing announced plans to build a Boeing 737 completion and finishing plant in China. The facility will be used to paint exteriors and install interiors into air-frames built in the United States. The location for the plant has not yet been revealed.
In June 2011 COMAC and Irish low-cost airline Ryanair signed an agreement to co-operate on the development of the C919, a 200-seat single-aisle aircraft which will compete with the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320.
