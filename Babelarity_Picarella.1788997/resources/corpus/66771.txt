It is one of the leading European manufacturers and distributors of major domestic appliances (washing machines, dryers, dishwashers, fridges, freezers, cookers, hoods, ovens and hobs). It claims to be the undisputed leader in major markets such as Italy, the UK and Russia. Founded in 1975 and listed on the Milan stock exchange since 1987, the Group posted sales of €2.7 billion in 2013.

Founded in 1975 as Merloni Elettrodomestici SpA by Vittorio Merloni, as a spin-off from Industrie Merloni. It was renamed Indesit Company S.p.A in 2005 after a company it acquired in 1987.
In the 1980s, with other Italian companies having been taken over by foreign appliance manufacturers, Merloni Household became the premier domestic producer in the industry. Since 1981 the company was going through a period of crisis, which ended in 1984, when Vittorio Merloni, having concluded his presidency of Confindustria, returned to managing Indesit. Profits and revenues of the company grew, and this led the Merloni family to decide in 1986 in favor of the company's entry into the stock market.
In 1987, Merloni Elettrodomestici, already listed on the stock exchange, acquired Indesit, its biggest rival on the Italian market which also had a certain international presence, as well as 33% of Philco Italy.

(Società Trevigiana Apparecchi Riscaldamento), an Italian company of Conegliano Veneto producer of kitchen hoods, which will be fully acquired in 2002 and merged with the Company in 2003.
In 1999, through Fineldo, the holding of Merloni family, acquired Panini, manufacturer of collectible stickers.
In 2000, Indesit took over the entire capital of Philco and acquired Stinol, the first Russian producer of household appliances.
The Company of Fabriano in 2002 entered the consumer electronics industry with the purchase of Sinudyne.
In February 2005, Merloni Elettrodomestici was renamed Indesit Company: Indesit is the best known of the Group’s brands outside Italy.
At the beginning of 2007, Indesit Company launched the Group’s new brand architecture: Hotpoint brand is combined with Ariston to form the Hotpoint-Ariston brand.
On 31 July 2009 the Indesit closed its plant at Kinmel Park, Bodelwyddan Denbighshire, Wales, UK. The factory employed 305 workers. The company blamed "continuing decline" in the market.
