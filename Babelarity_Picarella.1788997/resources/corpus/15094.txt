Jesé Rodríguez Ruiz (born 26 February 1993), simply known as Jesé (Spanish pronunciation: [xeˈse]), is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for Real Madrid as a forward.
A youth product of Real Madrid, he made his senior debuts with the club in 2011 and was promoted to the first team for the 2013–14 season.
Jesé earned 36 caps for Spain from under-16 to under-21 level, scoring 16 international goals.
Born in Las Palmas, Canary Islands, Jesé attracted interest from a number of teams such as FC Barcelona when he was playing for Huracán in 2005, but signed for Real Madrid's youth system in 2007, aged 14. Still a junior, on 16 January 2011, he made his senior debut with the reserves in Segunda División B, in a 5–0 home win against Universidad de Las Palmas CF.
After a successful 2010–11 season with Real Madrid's Juvenil A team that saw him score 17 goals, Jesé was promoted to the reserve team.
In July 2011, Jesé was called up by first-team manager José Mourinho for the pre-season tour. He made his unofficial debut with the main squad in a friendly against Los Angeles Galaxy on the 17th, coming on in the 64th minute for José Callejón.
Jesé scored his first official goal for Castilla on 2 October 2011 against La Roda CF, following an assist by Álvaro Morata, in an eventual 2–4 away loss. On 12 December, he was once again included in the list for the game against SD Ponferradina for the first round of the Copa del Rey, and replaced Cristiano Ronaldo for the final 15 minutes of a 2–0 away triumph.
On 24 March 2012, Jesé made his first La Liga appearance again coming on for Ronaldo, for the last ten minutes of a 5–1 home win over Real Sociedad. In late October, Mourinho said critically that he was being used at Castilla in a position that did not exist in the main squad. Two months later Ginés Carvajal, his agent, said that they would need to study options for the player's future if he was not permanently promoted to the first team the following year, with the guarantee he would receive significant playing time; in February 2013 Jesé stated he was confident he was doing well enough to be granted an opportunity, with B-side coach Alberto Toril later coming out in his defense, saying that he should learn to control his emotions.
In May 2013, Madrid president Florentino Pérez stated that sporting director Zinedine Zidane did not think that Jesé had to leave on loan. On 2 June, he scored a solo goal in a 4–0 home win against AD Alcorcón – with that goal, he broke the record for most goals in a single season at Castilla, set by Emilio Butragueño in 1983–84 with 21– which brought him praise from several quadrants, and he later stated he wanted to remain at the club, which was backed by coach Toril.
While at the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup, Jesé admitted that he could be on the move from Real Madrid after seeing first-team opportunities restricted. The club's technical director, Miguel Pardeza, clarified on 13 July that the player would remain at the club, and he extended his contract for a further four years late in the same month. Jesé made his Champions League debut on 2 October 2013, coming on as a 81st-minute substitute in a 4–0 home victory over F.C. Copenhagen for the group stage. He scored his first competitive goal for Real Madrid in his first El Clásico appearance on the 26th of October, netting from a Ronaldo assist following an injury-time counter-attack in a 1–2 loss at FC Barcelona.
On 23 November 2013, Jesé came on as a second-half substitute against UD Almería and contributed with his first two assists for the first team, in a 5–0 away win. His second goal came nearly one month later, netting the 3–2 winner at Valencia CF with eight minutes to go; continuing his fine form he provided an assist in Los Blancos' first match following the 2013–14 winter break, a 3–0 home victory over Celta de Vigo, and on 9 January he scored his first in the domestic cup, in a 2–0 success against CA Osasuna for the round-of-16 first leg, also at the Santiago Bernabéu. On 28 January 2014, in the Spanish Cup's quarterfinals second leg, Jesé started and netted the only goal in Real's home victory over RCD Espanyol (2–0 on aggregate). His league form continued when used, with goals against Athletic Bilbao, Villarreal CF and Getafe CF; on 18 March, however, just two minutes into the Champions League's round-of-16 second leg game against FC Schalke 04, he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee, being sidelined for the rest of the season.
Jesé returned from injury for the second leg of Real Madrid's tie against UE Cornellà in the Copa del Rey round of 32 on 2 December 2014, replacing Sami Khedira after 57 minutes and scoring the last goal of a 9–1 aggregate victory. On his injury, Jesé stated: "I had a very tough time, but I think that things in life happen for a reason. Maybe I had the injury because I needed to learn and become a more mature footballer." Later that month he was included in their squad which won the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, making a substitute appearance in a 4–0 win over Cruz Azul in the semi-finals. Jesé ended the season with a large amount of his appearances coming from the bench, partly due to the recovery time of his previous injury; he scored his first La Liga goal of the season on 4 February 2015 in a 2–1 victory over Sevilla FC.
He was a regularly used back-up when the team won the 2015–16 UEFA Champions League.
Jesé moved through the Spanish international youth setup, representing all sides between the under-16s and the under-21s. He made his debut with the former in 2009 and, with the under-17 side, he reached the final in the 2010 UEFA European Football Championship.
In the 2012 European Under-19 Championship held in Estonia, Jesé scored four goals only in the group stage, including a hat trick in a 3–3 draw against Portugal on 6 July. He netted his fifth in the final against Greece (1–0), and went on to be the top scorer of the tournament.
Jesé scored five goals for the Spanish under-20 team at the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Turkey, in an eventual quarterfinal exit, and received the Bronze Boot for the third best scorer of the tournament. The FIFA Technical Study Group identified Jesé with the following words: "Dangerous attacker, quick off the mark, good technique, excels in one-on-one situations."
On 6 February 2014, although he was still eligible to play for the under-21s, full side manager Vicente del Bosque revealed that the player was in his plans ahead of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil; however, in March, following his serious injury, his chances of attending the tournament were ended, and the manager described the situation as "a blow". Due to his eight months injury, Jesé missed Spain's qualification play-off against Serbia for the 2015 European U-21 Championship, in which Spain lost 2–1 and thereby missed qualification for the 2016 Summer Olympics.
Jesé can play from a midfield position (behind the striker) to a winger position on either side of the field, as well as a centre-forward. At Castilla, under Toril, he often played in a false 9 role in the team's 4–3–3 formation, and regularly switched flanks due to his ability to use both feet. Following his promotion to the first team in 2013, manager Carlo Ancelotti played him in a winger position, often cutting inside from the wing both with the ball and without, to create chances and score goals.
Two of Jesé's most common traits are his direct football style and technical ability, which have been described as "exceptional" and a "phenomenon". Jesé's manager Carlo Ancelotti described him as a "talent, it's in his genes." He is known for his skills and ability to shoot with both feet, as well as his pace; his pace coupled with his finishing and inability to be dispossessed easily led to comparisons to Portuguese superstar Cristiano Ronaldo. Jesé's vision, a trait he improved on since his beginnings, allowed him to develop into an effective passer.
In May 2014, Jesé was named by Daily Mirror as one of the twenty most promising young players in Europe. Sky Sports Spanish football expert Guillem Balagué commented: "in small spaces his technique is better than Ronaldo" and "better than Bale at the same age."
