Mohamed Lamine Zemmamouche (born March 19, 1985) is an Algerian football player who is currently playing for USM Alger in the Algerian Ligue Professionnelle 1 and the Algerian national team.
In December 2009, Zemmamouche was selected by Rabah Saâdane to play in the 2010 African Cup of Nations hosted in Angola, and as backup to Faouzi Chaouchi, he came on as a replacement in the semi-final against Egypt following Chaouchi's sending-off, before playing the entire 90 minutes of the Third-place Playoff against Nigeria.
Zemmamouche was the last player cut as Algeria coach Rabah Saâdane finalised his 23-man squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa.
Zemmamouche was also selected in the Algerian national team for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil as Algeria's second-choice goalkeeper. He contested just one qualifier ahead of the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil, filling in for Rais M'Bolhi against Burkina Faso.
