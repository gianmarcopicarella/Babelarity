Hainan Province Airlines became China's first joint-stock air-transport company following a restructuring in January 1993 and began scheduled services on 2 May 1993. The initial 250 million yuan (US$31.25 million) was financed by the Hainan government (5.33%) and the corporate staff (20%). The rest came from institutional shareholders. In 1996, the provincial airline was renamed Hainan Airlines.
American Aviation LLC, controlled by George Soros, had been a major shareholder of the airline since 1995.
Executive-jet operations with a Bombardier Learjet 55 were added in April 1995. In 1998, Hainan Airlines became the first Chinese carrier to own shares in an airport after it purchased 25% stake of Haikou Meilan International Airport.
In 2000, HNA Group was established and became parent company of Hainan Airlines. It also controlled Shanxi Airlines, Chang An Airlines and China Xinhua Airlines.
