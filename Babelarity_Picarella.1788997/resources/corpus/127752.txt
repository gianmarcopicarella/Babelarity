Cañete is a municipality in the Cuenca Province, Castile-La Mancha, Spain.
It is home to a Moorish-origin castle, and of a line of walls with a gate from the same age.
It is the birthplace of Álvaro de Luna and the origin of Sephardi Jew family Canetti (the most famous member of which is Nobel Prize in Literature laureate Elias Canetti) —in fact, Canetti is a bastardisation of Cañete—. It is also a birthplace of Manuel Polo y Peyrolón, an ultraconservative philosopher and scholar of clear anti-semitic penchant.
