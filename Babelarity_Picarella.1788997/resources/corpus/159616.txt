Ljungby is a locality, and the seat of Ljungby Municipality, Kronoberg County, Sweden, with 15,205 inhabitants in 2010.
Ljungby was originally a köping (instituted in 1829), which did not become a municipality of its own when the first local government acts took effect in 1863, but retained part of the surrounding rural municipality with the same name. In 1936 Ljungby got the title of a city. It is since 1971 the seat of the much larger Ljungby Municipality.
Much of the town centre was destroyed in a fire in 1953. The (at the time) modern style of the rebuilding characterized by e.g. Hotel Terazza remains controversial locally.
While Ljungby has a railroad track, it is since long abandoned. The only way to get there through collective means of transport is by bus.
In 1986, Metallica bassist Cliff Burton died in a bus accident close to Ljungby. There is a memorial stone by the Gyllene Rasten parking.
Ljungby has an oceanic climate in spite of its inland position. However it has significant temperature differences between seasons that in many ways resemble more continental types.
