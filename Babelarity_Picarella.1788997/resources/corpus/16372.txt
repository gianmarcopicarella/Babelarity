Fahrudin Jusufi (Serbian Cyrillic: Фахрудин Јусуфи; born 8 December 1939) is a former international footballer who played for Yugoslavia. He played as a full-back on both sides and was renowned for his never-say-die attitude, good defensive positioning and quality passing and technique. He is considered one of Yugoslavia's greatest defenders.
Jusufi was born in Zlipotok village near Dragaš (Vardarska Banovina, Kingdom of Yugoslavia). During his career, he played for FK Partizan, Eintracht Frankfurt, Germania Wiesbaden and FC Dornbirn, retiring in 1972. He was part of the Partizan squad when they became vice-champions of Europe after losing the 1966 European Cup Final against Real Madrid.
He started his coaching career seven years later, and also mainly in Germany, mainly with SG Wattenscheid 09, in the second division, but also in 1987–88 at first side Partizan.
On the national level, Jusufi played for Yugoslavia (55 matches), and was a participant at the 1962 FIFA World Cup and at the 1960 Summer Olympics, where his team won the gold medal.
In a 1991 interview for Serbian bi-weekly Tempo, Jusufi as a Serbian Muslim was asked if he is "experiencing any problems in regards to the current political situation" and "due to his ethnicity." Jusufi replied, "Why would I be experiencing any problems? I'm a Gorani, if that even interests anyone."
His son Sascha is also a retired professional footballer.
