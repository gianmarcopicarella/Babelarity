Scandal (1989) is a British drama film, a fictionalised account of the Profumo Affair based on 1987 Anthony Summers' book Honeytrap.
Starring Joanne Whalley as Christine Keeler and John Hurt as Stephen Ward, personalities at the heart of the affair, the film details the scandal that, in 1963, rocked the government of British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and may have contributed to the defeat of the ruling Conservative Party at the following year's general election.
The cast also includes Ian McKellen as John Profumo, Britt Ekland as Mariella Novotny, Bridget Fonda as Mandy Rice-Davies, Leslie Phillips as Lord Astor, and Roland Gift as Johnny Edgecombe.
The film's theme song "Nothing Has Been Proved" was written and produced by Pet Shop Boys and sung by Dusty Springfield.
The film was screened out of competition at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival. The film's original trailer on UK television commercials never showed any clips of the film but just a blank screen featuring the word "SCANDAL" in white text, with a voiceover saying "It's a scandal! Keep watching!" Another trailer featuring clips was subsequently shown, as a follow-on from the original.
An English bon-vivant osteopath is enchanted with a young exotic dancer and invites her to live with him. He serves as friend and mentor, and through his wide range of contacts and his parties she and her friend meet and date members of the Conservative Party. A scandal develops when her affair with the Minister of War comes to public attention.
