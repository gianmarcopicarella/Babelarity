From parallax measurements, the distance to this star can be estimated as 156 light-years (48 pc). It is visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 3.86. A stellar classification of G9 III identifies it as a giant star in the later stages of its evolution. It is an active X-ray source with a luminosity of 1.607 × 1030 erg s−1, making it one of the 100 strongest stellar X-ray sources within 50 parsecs of the Sun.
In Chinese caused by adaptation of the European southern hemisphere constellations into the Chinese system, 異雀 (Yì Què), meaning Exotic Bird, refers to an asterism consisting of γ Apodis, ζ Apodis, ι Apodis, β Apodis, δ Octantis, δ1 Apodis, η Apodis, α Apodis and ε Apodis. Consequently, γ Apodis itself is known as 異雀四 (Yì Què sì, English: the Fourth Star of Exotic Bird.)
