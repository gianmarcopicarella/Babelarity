Haris Silajdžić (Cyrillic: Харис Силајџић; born 1 October 1945) is a Bosnian politician and academic. In the 2006 elections, Silajdžić was elected as the Bosniak member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina for four years in the rotating presidency.
From 1990 to 1993 he served as the foreign minister of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and as the prime minister from 1993 to 1996. In 1996, he left the Party of Democratic Action because of personal reasons, and founded the Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina (SBiH). His SBiH entered the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina and become one of the leading Bosnian Muslim parties the following year.
In 2007, the International Court of Justice in the Hague acquitted Serbia of the charges of complicity in genocide brought against the "Federal Republic of Yugoslavia" by the Bosnian government. Silajdžić expressed disappointment at the court's ruling, but welcomed the fact that the court "ruled that Serbia and Montenegro had violated the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide by not preventing or punishing the perpetrators of the genocide.".
Silajdžić has been a member of the Bosnian delegation which negotiated the US-brokered Dayton Accords. He continues stressing that the document was essential in ending the genocide in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but now sees it as an obstacle in reunifying the country. Making strong steps and claims in 2006 and 2007 towards canceling certain parts of Dayton accords, he directly opposes the constitution of the country, thus being a very controversial political figure, famous on the Bosniak and infamous on the Serbian side. His main directions are abolishing the existence of Republika Srpska, breaking certain relations with Serbia and reforming the country towards unity. He continues to be a key figure in Bosnian politics. Originally, he was a member and vice-president of the Party of Democratic Action, but broke away from the party in 1997 by funding his own Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Silajdžić had a strong political comeback in the 2006 elections. He is backed by authorities and organizations throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina that voice dissatisfaction with the Dayton Accord provisions and oppose autonomy of the Republika Srpska entity within Bosnia-Herzegovina.
In 2005 he received a Doctor honoris causa by the Geneva School of Diplomacy and International Relations
