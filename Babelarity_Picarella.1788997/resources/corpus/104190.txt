Belsize Park is a London Underground station in Belsize Park, north-west London. It is on the Edgware branch of the Northern line, between Chalk Farm and Hampstead stations, and is in fare zone 2. It stands at the northern end of Haverstock Hill. In July 2011 it became a Grade II listed building.
The Royal Free Hospital is located a short distance to the north of the station.
The station was opened on 22 June 1907 by the Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway as an intermediate station on its line from Charing Cross to Golders Green. It is served by three lifts which descend 33.2 m (108 ft 10 in) to the platforms. There are 219 steps. The station was designed by Leslie Green and has his familiar facade of ox-blood faience with four round arched windows. It remained largely untouched until the late 1980s when the lifts were replaced and a new ticketing system installed.
Belsize Park is one of eight London Underground stations which have deep-level air-raid shelters underneath them. The shelter was constructed in World War II to provide safe accommodation for service personnel. Entrances to the shelter are at the junction of Haverstock Hill and Downside Crescent and off Haverstock Hill.
London Buses routes 168 and C11 and night route N5 serve the station.
