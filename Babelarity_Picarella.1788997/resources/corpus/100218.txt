In 2007, French President Jacques Chirac awarded Saad Hariri the "Legion d'Honneur" (Knight of the Legion of Honor).
Hariri was prime minister from 9 November 2009.
On 12 January 2011, minutes after Hariri posed for pictures with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office, the opposition parties resigned from the cabinet, as an objection for the inability of the government to take detrimental decisions, causing his unity government to collapse. In fact, Hezbollah and its allies withdrew from the government due to political tensions arose from investigations of the assassination of Rafic Hariri. Hezbollah operatives had been accused of the assassination of Rafic Hariri.
Hariri remained caretaker Prime Minister for another four months after the collapse of his cabinet. The new Lebanese government was finally formed on 13 June 2011 and is headed by Najib Mikati. Mikati created a Hezbollah-led government coalition.
On 12 December 2012, Syria issued an arrest warrants against Hariri, Future bloc deputy Okab Sakr and Free Syrian Army official Louay Meqdad in accusing them of arming and providing financial support for Syrian opposition groups. Upon this, Hariri released a statement, indicating that Bashar Assad is a "monster". Lebanese judicial sources argued that the arrest warrant would likely be ignored by Lebanon and that since both Hariri and Sakr have parliamentary immunity, they cannot be prosecuted.
