Carlos Velasco Carballo (born 16 March 1971) is a Spanish professional football referee.
He is affiliated with the Madrid committee and has officiated in Spanish Primera División since 2004, as well as in international matches since 2008.
Velasco officiated 2011 UEFA Europa League Final match in Dublin, between Porto and Braga.
On 20 December 2011, UEFA named him one of the twelve referees for UEFA Euro 2012. Velasco took charge of the tournament's opening match between Poland and Greece, attracting criticism after issuing a controversial first-half red card to Greek defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos, before sending-off Poland goalkeeper Wojciech Szczęsny in the second period as the teams drew 1–1 in Warsaw. He also attracted criticism for his performance as referee in the 2014 FIFA World Cup, in which the quarterfinal match he officiated between Brazil and Colombia was described as out of hand, with Brazil head coach Luiz Felipe Scolari saying that Velasco "should have done more to take control of the match" after a tournament-ending back injury was suffered by Brazil striker Neymar on a challenge by Colombian defender Juan Camilo Zúñiga.
