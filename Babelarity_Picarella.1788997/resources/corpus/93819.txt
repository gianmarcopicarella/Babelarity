The Hipposideridae are a family of bats commonly known as the Old World leaf-nosed bats. While it has often been seen as a subfamily, Hipposiderinae, of the family Rhinolophidae, it is now more generally classified as its own family. Nevertheless, it is most closely related to Rhinolophidae within the suborder Pteropodiformes (or Yinpterochiroptera).
The Hipposideridae contain 10 living genera and more than 70 species, mostly in the widespread genus Hipposideros. In addition, several fossil genera are known; the oldest fossils attributed to the family are from the middle Eocene of Europe. In their 1997 Classification of Mammals, Malcolm C. McKenna and Susan K. Bell proposed a division of Hipposideridae (called Rhinonycterinae in their work) into three tribes, one with two subtribes, but these tribes turned out to be non-monophyletic and have been abandoned. A different classification was proposed by Hand and Kirsch in 2003. More recently, Petr Benda and Peter Vallo (2009) proposed a separate tribe, Triaenopini, for the genera Triaenops, Paratriaenops, and possibly Cloeotis.
The genera included in Hipposideridae are (species counts only include living species):
Archerops (Miocene of Australia)
Anthops (one species; Solomon Islands and Bougainville Island)
Asellia (two species; Africa and southwestern Asia; Miocene fossils from Europe)
Aselliscus (three species; southeastern Asia and Melanesia)
Brachipposideros (Oligocene to Miocene of Europe and Miocene of Australia; sometimes included in Hipposideros)
Brevipalatus (Miocene of Australia)
Cloeotis (one species; Africa)
Coelops (at least two species; southeastern Asia; Miocene fossils from Africa)
Hipposideros (more than sixty species; Africa, southern Eurasia, and Australasia; oldest fossils from the Eocene of Europe; includes Pseudorhinolophus, sometimes considered a separate genus)
Miophyllorhina (Miocene of Australia)
Palaeophyllophora (Eocene to Miocene of Europe)
Paracoelops (one species; Vietnam)
Paraphyllophora (Eocene or Oligocene to Miocene of Europe)
Paratriaenops (previously included in Triaenops; three species; Madagascar and Seychelles)
Rhinonicteris (one species; Australia; earliest fossils from the Miocene)
Riversleighia (Miocene of Australia)
Triaenops (four species; Africa and southwestern Asia)
Vaylatsia (Oligocene of Europe)
Xenorhinos (Miocene of Australia)
