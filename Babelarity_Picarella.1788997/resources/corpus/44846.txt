Ilona Mitrecey (born 1 September 1993 in Fontenay-aux-Roses, Hauts-de-Seine), more commonly known as Ilona, is a French singer.
She became famous in France after the release of her hit single, "Un Monde parfait" ("A Perfect World"), a high-energy eurodance song which had already been released in Italy in March 2004 under the name 'Très Bien featuring Ilona', on 28 February 2005. The song reached #1 on France's SNEP charts on 6 March 2005, and stayed on top of the charts for 15 weeks. Her second single, "C'est les vacances", was released on 20 June 2005.
Ilona finished junior high at Neuilly-sur-Seine in Hauts-de-Seine. She has sung in many advertisements. Her father was the singer in the band playing in some shows of Canal Plus and he composed the music of some films of Max Pécas, and her mother, Sylvie, works at the Michel Lafon publishing house.
Her album was released on 10 October 2005.
Ilona very rarely does live performances, but she was coaxed into appearing on the nationally acclaimed show Hit Machine on M6 prior to the success of the single "Un Monde parfait".
In 2007, Ilona won an EBBA Award. Every year the EBBA recognizes the success of ten emerging artists or groups who reached audiences outside their own countries with their first internationally released album in the past year.
