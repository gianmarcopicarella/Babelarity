Lexi Belle, (born August 5, 1987), is the stage name of an American pornographic actress. She began her career in the adult film industry in 2006 at the age of 18.
Belle was born in Independence, Louisiana. She is of Irish descent. When she was six years old, her mother died in a car accident; Belle entered the foster care system, staying in a succession of homes for the next two years until she was placed with a more stable foster family that eventually intended to adopt her. Belle lived with them from age 8 to 12, but again became a ward of the state when her foster mother was diagnosed with cancer and, according to her foster cousin, found caring for Belle to be too taxing on her already weak existence.
In 2011, Belle was named by CNBC as one of the 12 most popular stars in porn. CNBC noted her multiple awards and nominations from AVN and XBIZ as well as the popularity of her website, one of the largest in the porn industry. She was the Penthouse Pet of the Month for May 2013 and the Pet of the Year for 2014.
In 2015, Belle made her mainstream acting debut as Hera in the action thriller, Samurai Cop 2: Deadly Vengeance, along with Kayden Kross and Tommy Wiseau.
Belle identifies as bisexual. She is an animal advocate. She volunteers on behalf of animal welfare agencies and shelters, and has identified dolphins, moose, and snow owls as creatures about which she is particularly passionate.
She is also a fan of Star Wars, with her favorite film being Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones.
