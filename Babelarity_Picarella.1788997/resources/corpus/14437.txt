Simone Zaza (Italian pronunciation: [siˈmoːne ˈdzaddza]; born 25 June 1991) is an Italian professional footballer who plays as a striker for Juventus and the Italian national team.
Zaza began his professional club career with Atalanta in 2008, where he remained for two seasons. In 2010, he moved to Sampdoria, where he was sent on loan spells to Juve Stabia, Viareggio and Ascoli. In 2013, he joined Sassuolo, where his performances earned him a transfer to defending Serie A champions Juventus in 2015. In his first season with the club, he immediately won a domestic double. At international level, Zaza made his senior debut for Italy in 2014, and went on to represent his nation at UEFA Euro 2016.
Born in Policoro in the province of Matera, Zaza grew up in Metaponto and began his youth career with Stella Azzurra team from Bernalda in 1997. He remained with the organization until 2002, when he moved to the youth academy of Valdera at the age of 11. He remained until 2006, when he was scouted by Serie A side Atalanta, whom he joined shortly after. He remained within the club's youth team for four years and even began to earn senior call-ups towards the end of the 2008–09 Serie A campaign. He made his Serie A debut on 19 April 2009 in a 0–1 home defeat to Reggina Calcio as a 76th-minute substitute for György Garics. He made two further substitute appearances for Atalanta that season, though he remained within the club's youth setup for the entire 2009–10 Serie A campaign.
In July 2010, Zaza officially transferred from Atalanta to fellow Serie A side Sampdoria on a four-year contract. With the Genoa-based club, he was enlisted in the club's Primavera (under-20) youth team for the 2010–11 season, though he also earned several first team callups, including two substitute appearances against Genoa and Fiorentina during the 2010–11 Serie A campaign. He was promoted to the first team at the conclusion of that season.
On 14 July 2011, Zaza was officially sent out on loan to Juve Stabia in the Serie B on what was set to be a season-long deal. After just four appearances and no goals for the club, Sampdoria opted to recall the player during the 2012 January transfer window. On 7 January 2012, the club loaned the player to Lega Pro Prima Divisione side, Viareggio on a six-month deal to provide the youngster with regular first team experience. His stint with the third-division club turned out to be very successful; he managed 11 goals in 18 league appearances, 17 as a starter.
After returning to Sampdoria on 30 June 2012, Zaza joined Ascoli on another season-long loan deal ahead of the 2012–13 Serie B campaign. He officially joined the club on 16 July and made his debut in a 1–3 home loss to Bari on 1 September. Zaza went on to score 18 league goals in 35 Serie B appearances (30 as a starter) en route to becoming the sixth top goalscorer for the season. His goals were unable to prevent Ascoli's relegation as they finished the season 20th in the league table. He returned to Sampdoria on 30 June 2013.
On 9 July 2013, Juventus purchased him outright from Sampdoria for €3.5 million, payable over three years. Simultaneously, he transferred to Sassuolo in a co-ownership deal for €2.5 million, to be paid in three years. He returned to play in Serie A in the first round of the league, with Sassuolo losing to Torino 2–0. On 1 September 2013, during the second round of the league, he scored his first goal in Serie A as the team lost 4–1 to Livorno. Thanks to his effort, Sassuolo secured their first point in the Italian top flight, with the goal scored in the fifth day against Napoli, 1–1.
On 20 June 2014, Sassuolo bought Zaza outright from Juventus for another €7.5 million. Juventus, however, retained the right to re-purchase Zaza for a reported €15 million by 30 June 2015 and €18 million by 30 June 2016.
On 7 July 2015, Juventus announced that they had exercised their option to sign Zaza for €18 million from Sassuolo. It was reported that the return of Domenico Berardi to Sassuolo was part of the deal. On 23 September 2015, Zaza opened the scoring in the 50th minute on his debut, a 1–1 draw against Frosinone. On 30 September 2015, he scored the final goal against Sevilla in the UEFA Champions League group stage to secure a 2–0 win; this was his first Champions League goal. He scored the opening two goals of a 4–0 win over cross-city rivals Torino in the Coppa Italia on 16 December.
Zaza has represented Italy at under-16, under-17, and under-19 levels.
On 31 August 2014, he was called up by head coach Antonio Conte as part of the senior team squad for a friendly match against the Netherlands and the first UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying game against Norway. On 4 September, Zaza made his debut with the Italian national team, playing as a starter in a 2–0 win against the Netherlands. He was fouled by Bruno Martins Indi in the ninth minute to win the penalty kick from which Daniele De Rossi scored Italy's second goal in the 2–0 victory. On 9 September, Zaza scored his first goal for the Italian national team in the 16th minute of their opening Euro 2016 qualifier against Norway, which ended in a 2–0 victory for Italy. On 31 May 2016, he was named to Conte's 23-man Italy squad for Euro 2016. On 17 June, he came off the bench to set-up Éder's match-winning goal against Sweden in the 88th minute of his nation's second group match, which qualified Italy to the Round of 16. On 2 July, he was brought on in the last few seconds of extra-time to take a penalty in the resulting penalty shoot-out against Germany in the quarter-final match up, which he subsequently missed after a bizarre run up to the ball, as Italy were defeated in the shoot-out 6–5 and eliminated from the tournament. In the events after the match, Zaza issued an apology to the fans of the national team stating, "I am sorry to have let the Italian people down. I missed the most important penalty of my life and I will carry this burden with me forever ... I have always taken penalties like that and I was convinced I would score, I had sent him [Manuel Neuer] the wrong way but the ball set off and it went like that."
Zaza is a quick, strong and well-rounded left-footed forward, with solid technique and an eye for goal. A versatile and hard-working player, he is capable of playing both as a centre-forward and off another player as a second striker. Due to his physical attributes and his positional sense, he also excels in the air; his powerful and offensive playing style has drawn comparisons to several players, such as Christian Vieri, David Trezeguet, Adriano, and Zlatan Ibrahimović.
