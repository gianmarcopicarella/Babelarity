Beverly Elaine Aadland (September 16, 1942 – January 5, 2010) was an American film actress.
She appeared in films including South Pacific. As a teenager, she co-starred in the Errol Flynn film Cuban Rebel Girls, and later entered a relationship with him.
Beverly Elaine Aadland (aka Woodsey, Little Wood Nymph and SC) was 17 at the time she was with actor Errol Flynn when he died of a heart attack on October 14, 1959 in Vancouver, British Columbia at the age of 50. In 1961, Aadland's mother, Florence Aadland, alleged in the book The Big Love that actor Flynn had a sexual relationship with her daughter starting at age 15, yet there's also speculation he was led to believe she was 18. The book was later made into a play starring Tracey Ullman. Beverly Aadland gave an account of her relationship with Flynn in People in 1988, confirming that she had had a sexual relationship with Flynn in her teens. Her relationship with Flynn was the subject of the 2013 movie The Last of Robin Hood. Aadland was played by Dakota Fanning.
In 1960 William Stanciu, her then boyfriend, died in her apartment after being shot in a struggle between the two.
Aadland was married and divorced twice before she married Ronald Fisher in the late 1960s. The couple had a daughter.
Beverly Fisher née Aadland died on January 5, 2010 at the Lancaster Community Hospital from complications of diabetes and congestive heart failure.
