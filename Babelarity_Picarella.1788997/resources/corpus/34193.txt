Ectoplasm (also exoplasm) (from the ancient Greek word ἐκτός - èktòs: outside and πλάσμα - plasma: literally that which has form) refers to the outer, non-granulated part of a cell's cytoplasm. This is opposed to the endoplasm which is the inner layer of the cytoplasm, and often is granulated. It is clear, and protects as well as transports things within the cell. Moreover, large numbers of actin filaments frequently occur in the ectoplasm, to form an elastic support for the cell membrane.
