The "Crazy Eights" unmanned train incident in 2001, ended in Kenton. The train, led by CSX Transportation engine SD40-2 #8888, left the rail yard in Walbridge, Ohio, and rumbled on a 66-mile journey through northwestern Ohio with no one at the controls, due to the throttle being applied on full instead of a brake. Two of the train's tank cars contained thousands of gallons of molten phenol, a toxic ingredient of paints and dyes harmful when it is inhaled, ingested, or comes into contact with the skin. For two hours, the train traveled along at speeds of up to 47 miles per hour until the crew of a second train coupled onto the runaway and slowly applied its brakes. Once #8888 was slowed to a speed of 11 miles an hour, a CSX employee, trainmaster Jon Hosfeld, ran alongside the train and climbed aboard, shutting down the locomotive. The train was stopped just southeast of Kenton. The incident later inspired the 2010 motion picture Unstoppable.
