Bruno of Segni, O.S.B., (c. 1047 – July 18, 1123) was a Catholic prelate, who Bishop of Segni and Abbot of Montecassino. He is now honored as an Italian Catholic saint.
Born at Solero (in today’s Province of Alessandria in the Piedmont) between 1045 and 1049, Bruno was educated in a Benedictine monastery near his birthplace and at Bologna, became a canon at Siena, and came to Rome in 1079. He was appointed Bishop of Segni in the Campagna the same year.
Bruno was closely connected with Pope Urban II, whom he accompanied to the Council of Clermont in 1095. In 1099, he entered the Abbey of Monte Cassino without resigning his see or severing his relations with the outside world. He undertook a mission to France for Pope Paschal II in 1106, remaining with the pope for several months after his return before returning to his cloister, where he was elected abbot in 1107. Paschal made no objection to this pluralism until Bruno condemned Paschal's signing of the Concordat of Segni in 1111, was forced to resign his abbacy and return to Segni.
Bruno died at Segni on July 18, 1123.
Pope Lucius III canonized Bruno in 1181. His works are principally exegetical. His Libellus de symoniacis, written prior to 1109, holds importance for its discussion of the meaning of simony and its stance on the sacraments of a simoniacal priest.
