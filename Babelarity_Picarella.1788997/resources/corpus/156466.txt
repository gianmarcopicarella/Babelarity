Goianira began in 1920 with the name São Geraldo, founded by Padre Pelágio Sáuter. In 1935 São Geraldo became a district. In 1940 it served as a base for the construction of the new capital of the state of Goiás, and the name was changed to Itaim. This name lasted until 1942 when it was changed to Itaité. After a popular movement the name was changed back again to São Geraldo. This name lasted until 1943 when it was changed to its final name, Goianira. This name was supposedly chosen because of the name of the daughter of a popular school teacher of the town. Source: Sepin
