In the 1970s, Glendale was the entertainment and night life center of metropolitan Denver. The Glendale of that era is often compared to Denver's LoDo neighborhood today. As an indication of its former popularity, at one point Glendale had more than 50 tavern licenses.
Glendale civic leaders hope to restore this reputation and atmosphere in the coming years through projects such as an improved water front. Mayor Pro Tem Mike Dunafon leads the effort to restore reputation and atmosphere by example—managing Shotgun Willie's, the self-proclaimed "best strip club in Denver", despite being in Glendale.
Glendale was formerly home to Celebrity Sports Center, a local landmark and family activity center established by Walt Disney and other celebrity investors. The landmark closed in 1994 to the disappointment of many.
