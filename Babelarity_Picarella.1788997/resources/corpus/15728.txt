José Enrique Gutiérrez Cataluña (born 18 June 1974) is a Spanish professional road racing cyclist. His career highlights include second place overall at the 2006 Giro d'Italia, winning a stage of the Vuelta a España and two stages at the Dauphiné Libéré.
Gutiérrez's name was brought up in the 2006 Operación Puerto doping case, and he was immediately made "non-active" (although not, according to team manager John Lelangu, suspended or fired) and so did not compete in any further events in 2006. Due to the Floyd Landis doping case of the 2006 Tour de France, Phonak withdrew their sponsorship of the team and it hence folded. Gutiérrez then moved down a division to Team LPR.
In 2010, Gutiérrez retired, but later came out of retirement to ride for Gobernación de Antioquia–Indeportes Antioquia in 2011.
