Blanus is a genus of amphisbaenians found in the Mediterranean region of Europe and North Africa. Like other amphisbaenians, Blanus are specialized for a subterranean existence, with a long, slender body, reduced limbs, and rudimentary eyes. The skull is powerfully constructed, allowing the animal to push through soil to create a burrow. The jaws are well-developed, with large, recurved teeth and a pair of canine-like teeth in the upper jaw.
Five extant species are currently known. The relationships of Blanus to other worm-lizards are not clear. The genus was formerly included in the Amphisbaenidae. More recent analyses suggest that blanids are more primitive, and are either related to Bipes or represent an even more ancient lineage.
A number of fossils from Europe have been referred either to Blanus or to the Blanidae.
