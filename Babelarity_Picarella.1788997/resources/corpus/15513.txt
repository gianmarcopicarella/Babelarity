José María Zárraga Martín (15 August 1930 – 3 April 2012) was a Spanish footballer who played as a midfielder.
Born in Las Arenas, Biscay, Zárraga signed for Real Madrid in 1949, spending the following two seasons with the reserve team. He made his La Liga debut on 14 October 1951 in a 3–1 home win against Valencia CF, finishing his first two years with the club with 48 games and two goals combined but failing to collect any silverware.
From 1953–60, Zárraga was an important midfield unit as the Merengues won 11 major titles, including five consecutive European Cups (that record would only be bettered by Francisco Gento, who won six) – he played in all the finals, and totalled 31 appearances combined in those victorious campaigns.
Zárraga continued to add to his trophy cabinet in his final two seasons with Real (notably back-to-back national championships), but only played in five matches combined. He retired in June 1962 at nearly 32, having appeared in 306 official games, and went on to have brief coaching spells in the decade, including six matches with CD Málaga in 1968–69 (after replacing Brazilian Otto Bumbel), which ended in top flight relegation; he also worked as a director of football with Valencia and Deportivo Alavés.
Zárraga won eight caps with the Spanish national team, his debut coming in 1955 in a 1–1 draw with England at the Chamartín.
In his last international appearances, Zárraga played as captain.
