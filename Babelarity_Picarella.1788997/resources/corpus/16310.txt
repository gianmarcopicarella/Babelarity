Kelly Tyler Olynyk (oh-LIN-ik; born April 19, 1991) is a Canadian professional basketball player for the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was an NCAA All-American while playing for the Gonzaga Bulldogs.
Born in Toronto, Olynyk moved to Kamloops, British Columbia in grade 7. He was studying for a Master of Business Administration at Gonzaga University, having earned a bachelor's degree in accounting in December 2012 with a 3.53 GPA. He announced on April 19, his 22nd birthday, that he would forgo his senior year and declare for the NBA draft. Olynyk was selected with the 13th overall pick by the Dallas Mavericks in the 2013 NBA draft and immediately traded to the Boston Celtics. He also represents Canada in international competitions.
Olynyk was born in Toronto and grew up in a basketball family. His father Ken was head men's basketball coach at the University of Toronto from 1989 to 2002 and the Canadian junior men's national team from 1983 to 1996, notably cutting future Canadian basketball icon Steve Nash from the junior national team. His mother Arlene was a Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS) women's basketball referee. From 1995 to 2004, his mother worked for the Toronto Raptors, with one of her jobs being scorekeeper. In 2003, Ken became athletic director at Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops, British Columbia, with the rest of the family soon joining him in Kamloops. He has two sisters, Jesse and Maya; the latter plays CIS basketball for the Saskatchewan Huskies. His family is of Dutch origin.
As a youth, Olynyk and future NBA player Cory Joseph played together for the Scarborough Blues club team; their mothers previously played together for the University of Lethbridge. The Blues rarely lost, though one of the losses came against rival Toronto 5–0, led by future NBA MVP Stephen Curry, who briefly lived in Toronto while his father, Dell, played for the Raptors.
Unlike many elite Canadian prospects in the early 21st century, he never attended a U.S. high school or prep school; he instead stayed home at South Kamloops Secondary School, exposing himself to U.S. competition and coaches while playing on provincial teams – competing at Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) and non-AAU tournaments in the States – and the Canadian junior national team. Olynyk developed as a point guard, continuing to play the position even after growing from 6'3" (1.90 m) to 6'10" (2.08 m) in grade 11.
Olynyk was named the Basketball BC outstanding high school player of the year in his grade 12 year, leading his South Kamloops Titans to a 36–2 record and a third-place finish at the BC AAA High School Boys' Basketball Championships.
Olynyk was also a quarterback for the Titans when he was in high school and broke his arm during a playoff game in 2007.
Olynyk played college basketball at Gonzaga from 2009 to 2013. He was mostly a bench player for the Bulldogs in his freshman and sophomore years, averaging around 12 to 13 minutes per game. In order to improve his game and get stronger, Gonzaga and Olynyk agreed that he would redshirt his junior year (2011–12), meaning he would practice with the team, but not play.
Olynyk returned to the Bulldogs lineup for the first game of the 2012–13 season, and had a great season, being selected as a Consensus First-Team All-American, as well as to the 2012–13 Academic All-America first team. Following his redshirted junior year, he opted for the NBA draft, thereby forgoing his senior year.
Olynyk was selected with the 13th overall pick by the Dallas Mavericks in the 2013 NBA draft and then traded immediately to the Boston Celtics for the rights to Lucas Nogueira and two future second round picks. On July 7, 2013, Olynyk signed the rookie scale contract with the Celtics after scoring 25 points on 9-of-13 shooting in his first summer league game in Orlando.
Olynyk was selected alongside teammate Jared Sullinger on Team Webber for the 2014 Rising Stars Challenge. After averaging 8.7 points and 5.2 rebounds in 70 games in 2013–14, he was named to the NBA All-Rookie second team.
In July 2014, Olynyk re-joined the Celtics for the 2014 NBA Summer League. On October 29, 2014, the Celtics exercised their third-year team option on Olynyk's rookie scale contract, extending the contract through the 2015–16 season. On December 15, 2014, he scored a career-high 30 points in a 105–87 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. On January 22, he injured his ankle after landing on the foot of Thomas Robinson in the fourth quarter of the Celtics' 90–89 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. After being projected to return soon after the All-Star break, Olynyk didn't show signs of being ready to return, and subsequently missed 18 games. He returned to action on March 4 against the Utah Jazz.
Olynyk missed the Celtics' 2015–16 season opener against the Philadelphia 76ers on October 28 after being suspended for his role in Kevin Love's left shoulder injury during the 2015 playoffs. Two days later, the Celtics exercised their fourth-year team option on Olynyk's rookie scale contract, extending the contract through the 2016–17 season. On December 11, 2015, he scored a season-high 28 points in a double overtime loss to the Golden State Warriors. On March 16, 2016, he returned to action for the Celtics after missing the previous 12 games with an injured right shoulder.
