The national anthem of Guatemala was written by José Joaquín Palma (1844–1911) and composed by Rafael Álvarez Ovalle. The anthem was adopted in 1896 as the winning entry in a competition held by the government. The lyrics were modified slightly in 1934 by Professor Jose Maria Bonilla Ruano, a Spanish grammar scholar. Some verses were softened in their bloody context while others were enhanced in their poetic beauty.
The anthem is often erroneously titled "Guatemala Feliz!" from its opening lyrics, but the anthem has no official name and is only referred to in the country as "Himno Nacional".
