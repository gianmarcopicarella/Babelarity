"Asche zu Asche" is a single by the German band Rammstein, from their first studio album, Herzeleid. The single was included as a "Bonus CD" for the re-released Australian Tour Edition of Sehnsucht, and as a separate CD Single. It contains the 1995 album version of "Asche zu Asche", and five live tracks taken from Live Aus Berlin. It was only released in Australia as promotion of the Big Day Out Festival '01, for which Rammstein were a headlining act.
Since its release, "Asche zu Asche" has been a staple in Rammstein's live shows. It is the only Rammstein song to have been played in every one of the band's tours. During performances the microphone stands would be set on fire near the end of the song and clouds of smoke would cover the stage. The song was played at almost every concert from 1995 to 2002. Initially it wasn't played during the Reise, Reise tour, but it was included again by the end of February 2005, ultimately replacing "Rein, Raus" in the setlists. More recently, "Asche zu Asche" has been absent during most of the Liebe ist f체r alle da tour, but has made some rare appearances in Germany and Denmark, replacing the song "Ich tu dir weh", which was indexed by the German Bundespr체fstelle f체r jugendgef채hrdende Medien. During these performances, the effects used for "Ich tu dir weh" are used, which means the flaming stand has not been used. In the current Made In Germany 1995-2011 Tour, the song is again on the setlist.
