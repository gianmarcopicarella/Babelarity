The Tajikistan Football Federation (Tajik: Федеросиюни футболи Тоҷикистон, Federosijuni futʙoli Toçikiston; Persian: فدراسیون فوتبال تاجیکستان‎‎) is the governing body of football in Tajikistan. The federation was founded in 1936 in the Tajikistan SSR as a sub-federation of the Soviet Football Federation. It was not until 1994 when the Federation was accepted by the international community including the continental and global associations.
