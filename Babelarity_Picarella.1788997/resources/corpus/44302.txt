Steinbach am Attersee is a municipality of the Vöcklabruck district in the Austrian state of Upper Austria. It is situated in the Hausruckviertel region on the eastern banks of the Attersee (Lake Atter), part of the Salzkammergut area.

The hard-to-reach settlement at the lake's steep shore remained a branch of the church of Sankt Georgen im Attergau until 1781. The Late Gothic St Andrew's Church was erected from about 1410.
