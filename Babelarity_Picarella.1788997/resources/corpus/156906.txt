Redding, officially the City of Redding, is the county seat of Shasta County, California, in the northern part of the state. It is located on the Sacramento River, which provided transportation and power in its early years. Interstate 5 passes close to the city, which has a population of 89,861. Redding is the largest city in the Shasta Cascade region, and it is the fourth-largest city in the Sacramento Valley, behind Sacramento, Elk Grove, and Roseville.
The site of Redding was settled by Native Americans of the Wintu tribe around the year 1000. Situated along the Siskiyou Trail, Redding became a stop on a trade and travel route connecting California's Central Valley and the Pacific Northwest. During the early 19th century, Hudson's Bay Company trappers and numerous European-American settlers passed through the site while traveling along the Siskiyou Trail.
The first European-American settler in the area was Pierson B. Reading, an early California pioneer. He was an admirer of John Sutter. In 1844, Reading received the Rancho Buena Ventura Mexican land grant for the area occupied by today's Redding and Cottonwood, California, along the Sacramento River. At the time it was the northernmost nonnative settlement in California.
Later, when the Southern Pacific Railroad built its rail line through the Sacramento Valley, it decided that the cost of making a small westerly detour to reach the mining town of Shasta was not in its interest. The railroad routed the tracks through an area then known as Poverty Flats, stimulating the development of the European-American town of Redding.
The railroad stop was named by the Southern Pacific for railroad man Benjamin B. Redding. In 1874 town residents changed the spelling of the name to "Reading", to honor local pioneer Pierson B. Reading. But the railroad did not officially recognize the change and the town restored its original spelling, "Redding", in 1880.
Redding was incorporated on October 4, 1887 with a population of 600 people. By 1910, Redding had a population of 3,572 supported by a significant mineral extraction industry (principally copper and iron). However, with the decline of these industries, which had also produced significant amounts of pollution damaging to local agriculture, the population dropped to 2,962 in 1920. By 1930 the population had recovered to 4,188 and then boomed during the 1930s with the construction of nearby Shasta Dam. The building of the dam, which was completed in 1945, caused the population to nearly double to 8,109 by 1940, and spurred the development of the commuter towns of Central Valley, Summit City, and Project City (all now called Shasta Lake City) — together named after the Central Valley Project.
In 1892 brothers John and Charles Ruggles thought that they could make some easy money by robbing a stagecoach. On May 10, 1892, the brothers robbed the Weaverville stage, but the take was small. Later, on May 12, the brothers stopped the stage again but Charles was hit with buckshot fired by a guard riding inside the coach. The brothers were later arrested. On July 24, 1892, a lynch mob wearing masks entered the jail and took the brothers out of their cell. In what became known as the lynching of the Ruggles brothers, the two men were hanged together from a derrick.
The city did not grow markedly until the 1950s, stimulated by postwar expansion of the lumber industry to satisfy pent-up demand for new housing across the country. In addition, construction of the Whiskeytown and Keswick dams brought many workers to the area. Completion of Interstate 5 in the late 1960s brought a higher level of traffic and added to development. By 1970, Redding had grown to 16,659 people.
In the 1970s, Redding annexed the town of Enterprise, located on the eastern bank of the Sacramento River. The city acquired other county areas, increasing the population to around 35,000. Enterprise residents voted to support the annexation primarily to acquire less expensive electricity via Redding's municipal utility, which receives power from the dam.
During the 1970s, the lumber industry suffered from declines in housing starts during the 1973-75 recession. Unemployment in Shasta County peaked at over 20%. The lumber industry was also required to satisfy new regulations to prevent further environmental damage due to the largely unrestricted logging over the previous hundred years. This had caused damage to some flora and fauna, as well as degraded watersheds, rivers, and streams. Other factors affecting the lumber industry were the depletion of virgin forest and automation in remaining mills. Employment levels dropped in the forest products industry below the postwar boom.
The economy of the city of Redding, as well as much of forested (primarily rural) Northern California, has had to make a transition from the industry to a service-based economy. The majority of the once plentiful blue-collar jobs, typical in the timber industry economy for decades, were permanently lost.
With the annexation of Enterprise and other areas of the county, Redding became the largest city of the vast region north of the San Francisco Bay Area and the Sacramento metropolitan area; it has retained this status for well over 30 years. It surpassed the former California timber capital of Eureka, located 150 miles to the west on the coast. By the time of the 1980 Census, the city's total population had grown to 41,995.
After a retail and housing boom of the late 1980s, the city grew to 66,462 in 1990. This boom continued until the mid-1990s, and then a slight slowdown occurred. In 2000 the population was 80,865. As of 2010, the population was 89,861, but as of a 2005 estimate, there were 89,641 people, which means that Redding's growth stagnated in the 5–10 years before 2010.
Redding is located at 40°34′36″N 122°22′13″W (40.576606, -122.370325). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 61.2 square miles (159 km2). 59.6 square miles (154 km2) of it is land, and 1.5 square miles (3.9 km2) of it (2.50%) is beneath water.
Redding is located at the very northwestern end of the Central Valley, which transitions into the Cascade foothills. The city is surrounded by mountains to the north, east, and west and fertile farm land to the south. Outermost parts of the city are part of the Cascade foothills, whereas southern and central areas are in the Sacramento Valley.
The elevation in Redding is 495 feet (151 m) on average, whereas anywhere to the north, east, or west of downtown ranges between 550 feet (170 m) and 800 feet (240 m) feet. Southern portions range between 400 feet (120 m) and 500 feet (150 m).
The Shasta Dam on the Sacramento River provides a considerable level of flood protection for Redding. The dam is capable of controlling flows up to 79,000 cubic feet (7,300 cubic meters) per second. Flow rate exceeded this threshold in both 1970 and 1974.
Soils in and around Redding are mostly of loam or gravelly loam texture, well drained, with red or brown mineral horizons. They are slightly or moderately acidic in their natural state.
Despite its relatively high latitude at 40°N, Redding has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csa), with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Winter (October–April) provides the most precipitation of any season in Redding—the weather tends to be either rainy or foggy and at times, snow occurs. Summers are hot and dry, but rain is possible, usually with a thunderstorm. The average daily maximum temperature in July stays near 100 °F (38 °C). The highest official recorded temperature in Redding was 118 °F (48 °C) on July 20, 1988. That was recorded at the nearby Redding airport. Some people in town recorded as high as 122 °F (50 °C) that same day. Redding has an average possible sunshine of 88%, the second-highest percentage (after Yuma, Arizona) of any US city.
While snow in Redding is uncommon, the city receives an average of 4.8 inches (12 cm) of wet snow annually. It rarely gets sleet and freezing rain. Frost occurs commonly in December through February, less often in March or November. Redding can have chilly to cold winters like the rest of the Central Valley to the south. In spring, rain is common. Tornadoes are extremely rare; flooding occurs only around the area near the Sacramento river. The coldest temperature recorded in Redding was 17 °F (−8 °C).
Keswick Dam, just upstream of Redding, marks the end of the free-flowing reach of the Sacramento River. It is the highest point upstream at which salmon and steelhead spawn. Fall-, late-fall-, and winter-run chinook salmon spawn in the river's gravel beds.
There are several rare and endangered species in Redding and its immediate vicinity. The Redding Redevelopment Plan EIR notes the California State listed endangered species, slender Orcutt grass (Orcuttia tenuis), occurs in eastern Redding near the municipal airport, where vernal pools are known to exist. This endemic grass is a Federal Candidate for listing and is endangered throughout its range, confined to several populations, and seriously threatened by agriculture, overgrazing, and residential development. Vernal pools provide the preferred habitat for this plant, which the California Native Plant Society considers a rare and endangered species. An ecology park at Turtle Bay in Redding has been created to allow study of native flora and fauna of the local area.

Redding has a diversified service economy with employment spread across a wide range of professional services, including health care services, retail, and tourism.
As of April 2014, the employment rate in Redding was 90.5 percent, with the majority of Redding citizens being employed in the Educational and Health Services industry. Other notable categories of employment includes the Shasta County and Redding Municipal Government, the Trade, Transportation and Utilities industry, as well as the Leisure and Hospitality Industry.
Since the late 1990s, Redding's economy has diversified away from timber mills and other wood-products industries. Through much of the post-World War II era, Redding's economy was supported by timber mills and other wood-products industry based on lumber from the forests, public and private, in the surrounding mountains. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, environmental restrictions, most notably the listing of the northern spotted owl as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, led to a dramatic reduction in timber harvests in the national forest. Industrial logging on private lands continues but automation has also reduced lumber employment. Sierra Pacific Industries, the largest private landowner in California, has its headquarters and several mills in the greater Redding area.
The city is the medical hub of rural far northern California, with two major general hospitals, Mercy Medical Center, and Shasta Regional Medical Center, as well as other specialty hospitals.

Simpson University, and Shasta College draw new residents to Redding. The city's population has grown in recent decades even as other timber-dependent parts of rural California have had population declines.
In the early 21st century, Redding has become a growing hub of startups and startup outsourcing, with over 40 startups, including You Caring (third-largest crowd-funding platform), TechniSoil (natural paving product used in 2014 Winter Olympics), and AirCover (Drones). It continues to be a great place for startups with many resources available locally.

Driven by its natural resources, Redding is home to several recreational startups and manufacturers such as Sea Breacher, Jetovator, Sky Ski, True Rec, The Fly Shop, Skyway Wheels, Paddleboards, and climbing gear. Startup outsourcing is also a growing trend due to the low cost of business, a tech savvy work force, and relative close proximity to San Francisco. Startups such as Axcient, NComputing, and Citelighter.

Redding has a long history of outdoor active living. Formation of the shastawheelman.org Shasta Wheelman was announced in the San Francisco Call on May 6, 1896, with 100 members; the group continues today with rides and events weekly. In the 1900s, the Wright Brothers, James and Albert, had a bicycle shop in downtown Redding. They eventually sold bicycles and cars from the same shop, and period photos show them taking ladies in long skirts on bicycle rides from Redding to the nearby town of Palo Cedro.
One of the first organized mountain bike races in the world, the Whiskeytown Downhill, was organized by Gary of Chain Gang in 1981, as a promotion for his bicycle shop. Gary Fisher was the winner.

The extensive Redding trail system makes the city an attractive destination. The city built the first piece of the Sacramento River Trail in 1983 and by 1991 had completed the 5.7-mile (9.2 km) loop from the Diestelhorst Bridge to the Ribbon Bridge. Today, the paved pathway stretches for more than 20 miles (32 km), takes several names, crosses the river in four places, and includes spur trails to Old Shasta and half a dozen Redding neighborhoods. Key connections came with the 1990 Stress Ribbon Bridge, the first bridge of its kind in North America, and the Sundial Bridge, completed in 2004.
The Sacramento River Trail is one of the few paved pathways; an approximately 220-mile (350 km) trail system continues to be extended west of Redding, with connections being added to neighborhoods to improve local access west. With few exceptions, the trails are open to people on foot, bicycle, or horseback.
Groups and individuals collaborated on this project, including the City of Redding, Shasta County, Bureau of Land Management, McConnell Foundation, Redding Foundation, Whiskeytown, Bureau of Reclamation, and many others. Friends of the Redding Trails is a local group supporting trail improvements. Local long-boarders from Skate Movement can be seen frequently.
The trails organization American Trails held their symposium in Redding in 2000 and relocated to the area. Shasta Living Streets is a local organization working to support walkable cities and better bikeways locally. Redding received a Bicycle Friendly Community bronze status in 2012 from the League of American Bicyclists.
