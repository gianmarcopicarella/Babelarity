Stefano Domenicali (born May 11, 1965) is an Italian manager, currently CEO of Italian sports car manufacturer Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A.. From 2008 to 2014 he was the team principal of the Ferrari Formula One team.
Domenicali was born to a banker in Imola. He always believed that he was destined to a career in motorsport due to his birthplace. As a child, he used to go to the race track at weekends to help out in the paddock and in the media centre 
Domenicali studied business administration at Bologna University, graduating in 1991. Upon graduation, he joined Ferrari in 1991, where he worked in company's fiscal administration. Between 1992 and 1994, he was race director at Mugello and was involved in MotoGP, DTM and other racing series. In 1995, he was appointed head of personnel in Ferrari's sporting department and was also involved with sponsorship liaison, before being promoted to Team Manager in December 1996. He remained there till January 2001. After a brief stint as Logistics Manager, he became the team's Sporting Director in 2002. On November 12, 2007 Ferrari announced Domenicali would take on the role of Director of the Ferrari Formula One team, a position previously held by Jean Todt, and became team principal in 2008. Under his leadership, Ferrari won the 2008 Constructors' Championship, before enduring a less competitive 2009 season in which the team won only a single race. In 2010, the team won five races and finished third in the Constructors' Championship, behind Red Bull Racing and McLaren. Domenicali led the team into 2011, which saw Alonso finish fourth in the championship table, two places ahead of Massa in sixth. Then came the 2012 season, which saw Fernando Alonso just missing out on the title, despite having a largely uncompetitive car. He and Ferrari claimed three Grand Prix victories and placed second in both the Drivers' and Constructors' Championships. He was named one of "The Men of the Year 2012" by Top Gear magazine for keeping Ferrari at sharp end of F1, against the odds. Domenicali resigned as Ferrari team principal in April 2014.
In October 2014, Domenicali was hired by Audi, where he was rumored to be spearheading their Formula One entry in 2016. He was also appointed as head of the FIA's Single-Seater Commission. On 15 March 2016 he was appointed CEO at Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A., succeeding Stephan Winkelmann.
