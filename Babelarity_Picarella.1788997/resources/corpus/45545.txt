"Say You, Say Me" is a song written and recorded by Lionel Richie for the film White Nights, starring Mikhail Baryshnikov and Gregory Hines. The single hit number 1 in the US and on the R&B singles chart in December 1985. It became Richie's ninth number one on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. The track is not available on the soundtrack album to the film, because Motown did not want Richie's first single since the Can't Slow Down album to appear on another record label. It finally appeared on the Dancing on the Ceiling album released in 1986. A 50 sec clip was used in an episode of TV show "Valerie" in 1987.
The track won an Academy Award for Best Original Song and a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song as well. A music video was also made for the song.
In 2008, the song was ranked at #74 of the top songs of all time on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, commemorating the first 50 years of the chart.
In 2012, Lionel Richie re-recorded the song with Danish pop singer-songwriter Rasmus Seebach. The duet is featured on Richie's album Tuskegee, for which Richie has picked a host of best-selling singers from around the world in collaborations.
