Azle is a small city located in Parker and Tarrant counties in the U.S. state of Texas. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 10,947.
Azle is on State Highway 199, 16 miles (26 km) northwest of downtown Fort Worth, in the northwest corner of Tarrant County; the town extends partly into Parker County and Wise County.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 8.8 square miles (22.9 km2), of which 8.8 square miles (22.8 km2) is land and 0.015 square miles (0.04 km2), or 0.20%, is water.
The first recorded settlement at the site occurred in 1846, when a young doctor named James Azle Stewart moved into a cabin built by a Dutchman named Rumsfeldt. Other settlers came and established themselves near the local streams, Ash Creek, Silver Creek, and Walnut Creek. Stewart helped establish the first cemetery, Ash Creek. The oldest graves there are those of Dave Morrison (1849–1874) and W. P. Gregg (1833–1874). The first post office opened in 1881, and the town took the name of O'Bar, in honor of the man who obtained the postal service. A short time later in 1883, the name was changed at the request of Stewart, who donated the land for a townsite, in order to have the town named Azle. The community's economy was based on agriculture. Multiple crops were grown, including wheat, corn, peanuts, sorghum, and cotton. Watermelons, cantaloupes, peaches, plums, and pears were also produced. Dairy farming became important in the early decades of the twentieth century, when local milk products were sold to creameries in Fort Worth. The population of Azle grew steadily, and by 1920, the census recorded 150 residents. By 1933, State Highway 34 (later State Highway 199), had reached Azle from Fort Worth, greatly improving transportation capabilities between the town and the city. Also, Eagle Mountain Lake was formed by a dam on the Trinity River, east of Azle.
In the late 1930s, electricity was supplied to Azle and the surrounding countryside. The population grew between 1940 and 1960 from 800 to 2,696. It was 5,822 by 1980. After the 1930s, agriculture gradually declined; fields were converted from wheat and corn production to housing developments. Manufacturing increased, and in 1984, Azle had 26 businesses. In 1985, the population was estimated at more than 7,000. The town's proximity to Fort Worth and its position as the "Gateway to Eagle Mountain Lake" have made Azle a popular place to live. In 1990, the population was 8,868. The population grew to 9,600 by 2000.
