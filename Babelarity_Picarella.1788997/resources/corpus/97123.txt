Klaus Teuber (born June 25, 1952) is a German designer of board games.
He won the Spiel des Jahres award four times, for The Settlers of Catan, Barbarossa, Drunter und Drüber and Adel Verpflichtet.
Teuber's By Hook or Crook, published by Avalon Hill in 1991, was an early import of a German-style game into the American market.
Teuber retired from his profession as a dental technician to become a full-time game designer in 1999. As of 2007, he now lives in Canada with his wife Claudia. They have two sons, Guido and Benny.
