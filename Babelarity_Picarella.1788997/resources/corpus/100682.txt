The Communist Party of Belarus (Belarusian: Камуністы́чная па́ртыя Белару́сі, Kamunistychnaya Partyia Belarusi; Russian: Коммунистическая партия Беларуси, Kommunisticheskaya Partiya Belarusi) is a communist party in Belarus. It was created in 1996 and supports the government of president Alexander Lukashenko. The leader of the party is Tatsyana Holubeva.
The party suggested merging with the Party of Communists of Belarus (PKB) on July 15, 2006. While the Communist Party of Belarus is a pro-presidential party, the Party of Communists of Belarus was one of the major opposition parties in Belarus. According to Sergey Kalyakin, the chairman of the PKB, the so-called "re-unification" of the two parties was a plot designed to oust the opposition PKB.
The main foreign policy goal of strengthening the party proclaimed national security through the development of Belarus-Russia Union State and the phase reconstruction voluntarily renewed Union nations, strengthening its political and economic independence.
As a member of the world Communist movement, the KPB enjoys relations with other communist parties in the region and throughout the world to a much greater extent than the PKB, which many in the region have considered "pro-Western."
At the 2004 parliamentary election, the KPB obtained 5.99% and 8 out of 110 seats in the House of Representatives, in 2008 merely 6 seats and even less in 2012 with 3 seats. Still, because of the party's support for President Lukashenko, 17 of its members were appointed by him in the upper house, the Council of the Republic, in 2012.
