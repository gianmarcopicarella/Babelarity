The XXXVII International Baseball Federation (IBAF) Baseball World Cup was held in the Republic of China (Taiwan, competing under the name of Chinese Taipei) from November 6 through November 18, 2007. Four stadiums hosted. Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium and Taichung Baseball Field in Taichung City, Tianmu Baseball Stadium in Taipei City and Sinjhuang City all played host to the tournament. Sixteen teams participated. At one time, Venezuelaâ€™s participation was in question due to possible sanctions to be considered by the International Baseball Federation in the wake of their refusal to grant visas to a youth team from Taichung to participate in the Youth World Baseball championships in August, 2007, but they were allowed to participate. China was originally scheduled to participate in Pool B, but dropped out and was replaced by Thailand, who placed fifth behind China at the Asian Games.
With the exception of the opening game of the tournament, all group A games are played at Taichung Baseball Field, Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium and Douliu Baseball Stadium.
All group B games are played either at Tienmu Baseball Stadium in Taipei City or at Xinzhuang Baseball Stadium in Taipei County.
The IBAF announced the following awards at the completion of the tournament.
