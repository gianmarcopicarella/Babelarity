In 2011, Infosys was accused of committing visa fraud by using B-1 (visitor) visas for work requiring H-1B (work) visas. The allegations were initially made by an American employee of Infosys in an internal complaint. He subsequently sued the company, claiming that he was harassed and sidelined after speaking out. Although that case was dismissed, it along with another similar case, brought the allegations to the notice of the US authorities — and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and a federal grand jury started investigating.
In October 2013, Infosys agreed to settle the civil suit with US authorities by paying US$34 million. Infosys refused to admit guilt and stressed that it only agreed to pay the fine to avoid the nuisance of 'prolonged litigation'. In its statement the company said "As reflected in the settlement, Infosys denies and disputes any claims of systemic visa fraud, misuse of visas for competitive advantage, or immigration abuse. Those claims are assertions that remain unproven".
In July 2014, former US employees of Infosys have filed a lawsuit against it for alleging discrimination because of their inability to communicate in Hindi. According to the lawsuit filed in the US District Court of Eastern District of Wisconsin, the former employees alleged that they were "excluded" from work conversations by their supervisors and co-workers who "regularly spoke in Hindi" in front of them. The case has been filed by Layla Bolten, Gregor Handloser and two more employees. Bolten was hired as a tester, while Handloser was hired by Infosys in 2004 as a sales manager.
In 2015, the Department of Labor investigated Infosys after claims were made that the company used workers with H-1B visas to replace workers at Disney and Southern California Edison. Florida Sen. Bill Nelson also asked the Department of Homeland Security to investigate reports of layoffs at Disney.
House of Fraser, a British-based department store opted for Infosys as strategic partner to transform its business channel, IT infrastructure and to expand its global footprint.
