The Estadio Gigante de Arroyito (Spanish pronunciation: [xiˈɣante ðe aroˈʝito]) is a sports stadium in Rosario, Argentina. It is the home of the Rosario Central football team.
The stadium was originally opened in 1926 and remodeled to concrete in three stages, the first in 1957, the second in 1963 and the third in 1968.
In the 1978 World Cup, all three second-round games of the Argentine national football team were played in the Gigante. Local hero Mario Kempes enjoyed the support of the fans and went on to become the top scorer of the tournament.
The stadium hosted the Rugby Championship encounter between the Pumas and the Wallabies in October 2012.
