Marcos Alonso Mendoza (born 28 December 1990) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for Italian club Fiorentina as a left back or midfielder.
He started his career with Real Madrid, going on to represent mainly Bolton Wanderers in England – where he amassed Premier League totals of nine games and one goal over the course of two seasons, spending three in total with the club – and Fiorentina from Italy.
Born in Madrid, Alonso joined Real Madrid's youth academy still an infant, going on to represent every youth side in the following years. In 2008 he reached Real Madrid Castilla which competed in Segunda División B, and first appeared for the reserve team on 22 February 2008, playing the entire game in a 0–1 home loss against AD Alcorcón.
On 11 December 2009, Alonso was first summoned by the main squad – coached by Manuel Pellegrini – for a La Liga match at Valencia CF. Eventually, he did not make the final list of 18, and his debut arrived on 4 April of the following year as he came on as a substitute for Gonzalo Higuaín in the 90th minute of a 2–0 win at Racing de Santander.
Alonso joined Bolton Wanderers of the Premier League for an undisclosed fee, on 27 July 2010. He made his competitive debut for the club in a Football League Cup 1–0 away win against Southampton on 24 August; his first league appearance arrived on 1 January 2011, starting for suspended Paul Robinson in a 1–2 away loss to Liverpool at Anfield.
Alonso scored his first goal for Bolton on 31 March 2012, netting the second in an eventual 3–2 success at Wolverhampton Wanderers. At the end of the 2012–13 season he was voted The Bolton News' player of the year, winning 37% of the vote: Marc Iles wrote, "...this has been a break-out season for the former Real Madrid starlet. Alonso has grown in stature and become a consistent performer at full-back – chipping in with some important goals too."
In May 2013, Alonso signed for Italian side ACF Fiorentina on a three-year deal, despite being offered a new contract by Bolton manager Dougie Freedman. On 30 December, after the player had made nine official appearances, Sunderland boss Gus Poyet announced that he would join on 1 January 2014, on loan until the end of the campaign.
Alonso played his first game with the Black Cats on 7 January 2014, featuring the full 90 minutes in a 2–1 home win over Manchester United for the League Cup semifinals' first leg and being given the Man of the match award by Sky Sports. He appeared in the final of the competition on 2 March, not being able to prevent a 1–3 loss against Manchester City; overall he contributed with 20 appearances all competitions comprised, helping his team retain its top flight status.
Alonso's grandfather, Marcos Alonso Imaz, played eight years with Real Madrid's first team. His father, Marcos Alonso Peña, played several seasons in Spain's top flight, most notably for Atlético Madrid and FC Barcelona, and both represented Spain at senior level.
On 2 May 2011, Alonso was arrested following his involvement in a car accident in Madrid. He was the driver of a car that collided with a wall, killing one of the passengers, a 20-year-old woman. He is alleged to have been over the legal alcohol limit for driving.
