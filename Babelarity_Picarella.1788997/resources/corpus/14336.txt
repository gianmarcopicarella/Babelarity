Football Club Libourne, formerly known as AS Libourne or Libourne Saint-Seurin-sur-L'Isle, are a French football team from the town of Libourne in Aquitaine. They currently play in the DH Ligue d'Aquitaine (sixth tier of French football).
The club was founded by Georges Kany in 1935 as Football Club Libourne. The club then became omnisports in 1966 and thus changed its name to Association Sportive Libournaise or simply AS Libourne. Nearly three decades later, in 1998, the club merged with AS Saint-Seurin and became Football Club de Libourne Saint-Seurin-sur-L'Isle. However, in October 2009, this merger was undone: AS Libourne returned to its old name (Football Club Libourne) and AS Saint-Seurin disappeared.
The club, nicknamed the penguins, were promoted to Ligue 2 from Championnat National after the 2005–2006 season, but relegation followed after finishing 19th in 2007–2008. The downfall continued and as of the 2013–14 season the club is playing in the DH Ligue d'Aquitaine (sixth tier of French football) after being champions of the DSR Ligue d'Aquitaine (seventh tier) in 2013.
