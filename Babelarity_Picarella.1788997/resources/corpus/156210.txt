The Cauto River or Río Cauto, located in southeast Cuba, is the longest river of Cuba.
It flows on a total length of 370 km (230 mi) from the Sierra Maestra to the west and north-west, and enters the Caribbean Sea north of Manzanillo. However, it provides only 110 km (70 mi) of transport waterway. Its water is not drinkable.
It flows through the provinces of Santiago de Cuba and Granma, and the communities of Palma Soriano, Cauto Cristo and Rio Cauto are located along the river. It is one of the two navigable rivers in Cuba. The other, Río Sagua la Grande, is the 2nd longest river in Cuba and is also not drinkable like the Río Cauto.
