Ericsson Globe (originally known as Stockholm Globe Arena, commonly referred to in Swedish simply as Globen (The Globe)) is an indoor arena located in Stockholm Globe City, Johanneshov district of Stockholm, Sweden. The Ericsson Globe is the largest hemispherical building on Earth and took two and a half years to build. Shaped like a large white ball, it has a diameter of 110 metres (361 feet) and an inner height of 85 metres (279 feet). The volume of the building is 605,000 cubic metres (21,188,800 cubic feet). It has a seating capacity of 16,000 spectators for shows and concerts, and 13,850 for ice hockey.
It represents the Sun in the Sweden Solar System, the world's largest scale model of the Solar System.
On February 2, 2009, the naming rights to the Stockholm Globe Arena were officially acquired by Swedish telecommunications company Ericsson, and it became known as the Ericsson Globe.
The Globe is primarily used for ice hockey, and is the former home arena of AIK, Djurgårdens IF, and Hammarby IF. It opened in 1989 and seats 13,850 for ice hockey games, but is also used for musical performances as well as other sports than ice hockey, for example futsal (indoor football). It is owned by FCA fastigheter. The third team to play a home game in their league was Huddinge IK (three home games there, all in 1993), followed by Hammarby IF (20 home games in The Globen to this day) and AC Camelen (one game in 1998, in the sixth level league, with 92 spectators). The first international game played in Globen was between Hammarby IF (Sweden) and Jokerit (Finland) a couple of weeks before the grand opening, although the players were only 12 years old at the time (born 1977) and it was a friendly game. The arena has been the home of the finals of Sveriges Television's yearly music competition Melodifestivalen since 2002. Ericsson Globe has hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2000 and Eurovision Song Contest 2016.
The arena hosted NHL Challenge series, when teams from the NHL came to Sweden to play against Swedish teams: the Vancouver Canucks in 2000, the Colorado Avalanche in 2001 and the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2003.
The first two games of the 2008–09 season of the NHL, between the Ottawa Senators and the Pittsburgh Penguins were played in the Globen, although the rink was altered to NHL specifications.
The first two games of the 2009-10 season of the NHL, a home-and-home series between the St. Louis Blues and Detroit Red Wings October 2–3.
The first two games of the 2010-11 season of the NHL, a home-and-home series between the San Jose Sharks and Columbus Blue Jackets took place on October 8 and 9, 2010. The game on October 8 was won by San Jose Sharks 3-2. The second game, on October 9, was won 3-2 in overtime by Columbus Blue Jackets.

A small cottage in aluminum with a 12-square-metre (130 sq ft) base was placed upon the Globe on May 26, 2009. The artist's intention with the arrangement is to illustrate two important symbols for Sweden: the high-technology Globe building and the traditional, simple small countryside cottage in Falu red with house corners painted in white. The house was positioned some distance from the exact top position of the Globe. The artist hopes he will eventually manage to place a similar cottage on the Moon. The cottage remained on the Globe until October 2009.
Skyview is an exterior inclined elevator which transports visitors to the top of the arena for a virtually unobstructed view of Stockholm.
It has two spherical gondolas, each able to accommodate up to 16 passengers, which travel along parallel tracks on the exterior of the south side of the globe.
Skyview opened in February 2010 and carried 160,000 people during its first year of operation.
