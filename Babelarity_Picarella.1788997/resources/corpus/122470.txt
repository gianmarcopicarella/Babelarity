West Low German, also known as Low Saxon (literally: Nether-saxon; Low German: Nedersassisch, Nedersaksies, Platduuts, Plat(t); Dutch: Nedersaksisch; German: Niedersächsisch), is a group of dialects spoken in parts of the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark. Together with East Low German it forms the dialect group of Low German language (German: Niederdeutsch or Plattdeutsch, Dutch: Nederduits).
The language area comprises the North German states of Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia (the Westphalian part), Bremen, Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein and Saxony-Anhalt (the northwestern areas around Magdeburg) as well as the northeast of The Netherlands (i.e. Dutch Low Saxon, spoken in Groningen, Drenthe, Overijssel and northern Gelderland) and the Schleswigsch dialect spoken by the North Schleswig Germans in the southernmost part of Denmark.
In the south the Benrath line and Uerdingen line isoglosses form the border with the area, where West Central German variants of High German are spoken.
