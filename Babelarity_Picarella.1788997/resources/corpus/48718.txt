Order of the Yugoslav Star (Croatian: Orden jugoslavenske zvijezde; Serbian: Orden jugoslovenske zvezde; Slovene: Red jugoslovanske zvezde; Macedonian: Орден југословенска ѕвезда) was the highest National order of merit awarded in Yugoslavia. It was divided into four classes. The highest class, the Yugoslav Great Star was the highest state decoration awarded in Yugoslavia. The order was mostly awarded to foreign heads of state for the development and strengthening of peace and cooperation between nations.
The Order of the Yugoslav Star was also the second highest order of merit in Serbia and Montenegro.
Order of the Yugoslav Star was founded by the President of Yugoslavia Josip Broz Tito on 1 February 1954 and had three Classes. Law on Decorations was amended on 1 March 1961, so from then on, the Order had four Classes:
Yugoslav Great Star — highest decoration in SFR Yugoslavia
Yugoslav Star with Sash (before 1961 Order of the Yugoslav Star, I Class) — 6th highest decoration in SFR Yugoslavia
Yugoslav Star with Golden Wreath (before 1961 Order of the Yugoslav Star, II Class) — 14th highest decoration in SFR Yugoslavia
Yugoslav Star on Cravat (before 1961 Order of the Yugoslav Star, III Class) — 24th highest decoration in SFR Yugoslavia
After the dissolution of SFR Yugoslavia, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (and later Serbia and Montenegro) continued to use some of the decorations of former Yugoslavia, among them Order of the Yugoslav Star. In the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Order of the Yugoslav Star was the second highest order after the Order of Yugoslavia. During this time the four Classes of the order were named:
Yugoslav Great Star — 2nd highest decoration in FR Yugoslavia (after the Order of Yugoslavia)
Yugoslav Star, I Class — 7th highest decoration in FR Yugoslavia
Yugoslav Star, II Class — 20th highest decoration in FR Yugoslavia
Yugoslav Star, III Class — 31st highest decoration in FR Yugoslavia
The Order was usually awarded to foreign heads of state and other distinguished foreigners who visited Yugoslavia. Up to 1985, the Yugoslav Great Star was awarded 127 times of which 115 to foreigners and 12 to Yugoslav citizens.
