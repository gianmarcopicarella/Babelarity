Glenn Loovens (born 22 September 1983) is a Dutch professional footballer who plays as a centre back for Sheffield Wednesday.
Born on 22 September 1983, Loovens is the son of Hans, who played for FC Twente. He also has a brother called Ivo. He signed for the Feyenoord youth academy when he was twelve years old, where his team mates included Robin van Persie and Said Boutahar. In 2001, manager Bert van Marwijk promoted him to the first team.
Loovens came through the Feyenoord youth system and made his debut against PSV Eindhoven in the 2001–02 season in the Feyenoord team that later won the UEFA Cup, alongside Robin van Persie, Civard Sprockel and Ferne Snoyl. In the later seasons, he failed to make good on his promising start as he quickly lost his position in defence to Patrick Paauwe again. He made his European debut at 19 years old, in a 2–0 defeat to Dynamo Kiev at the Olympic Stadium in Kiev on 23 October 2002.
Loovens spent the 2005–06 season on loan at Championship side Cardiff City and impressed enough so that they signed the promising young defender on a permanent deal after several months of negotiations for a reported fee of £250,000. He originally formed a defensive partnership with club captain Darren Purse but the 2007–08 season saw Purse lose his place in the side to Roger Johnson and the pair went on to form a vital base for the team to build on, including playing alongside each other in all 6 matches during the clubs run to the 2008 FA Cup Final. Loovens found the back of the net in the final against Portsmouth but it was disallowed for an earlier infringement. The 2007–08 season also saw Loovens make his 100th appearance in all competitions for Cardiff by playing against Hull City on 12 March.
Loovens was the subject of transfer interest for most of summer 2008, with Old Firm rivals Celtic and Rangers emerging as leading candidates to secure his signing. Walter Smith, manager of Rangers, declared his interest in Loovens and made an offer for his services but their valuation of the defender was rejected by Cardiff. On 16 August 2008, Loovens joined Scottish champions Celtic on a four-year contract for a fee of around £2.1 million Loovens stated that Parkhead was his preferred destination as he will get the chance to play in the Champions League. He made his Celtic debut on 23 August 2008, in a 3–0 win over Falkirk at Celtic Park. His first goal came on 23 September 2008 in a Co-op Insurance League Cup tie, also at Celtic Park, as Celtic beat Livingston 4–0.
Loovens scored the winning goal against Hearts in injury time on 20 September 2009, to send Celtic top of the table. He scored an own goal in a 1–3 defeat against Rangers in October 2010 and was criticised for his performance in Celtic's next game, a League Cup win over St Johnstone. Loovens paid for his poor form, as he was dropped for the following match, also against St Johnstone.
Loovens signed a short-term deal in December 2013 for Sheffield Wednesday after impressing during a short training stint. He then decided to extend his contract with the club until May 2014.
Towards the end of that summer, on 13 July 2014, Loovens then extended for a further year after reportedly rejecting several contract offers from other clubs, both in England and abroad. He was also then promptly announced as club captain for the 2014/15 season by head coach Stuart Gray.
Loovens received his first senior cap for the Netherlands when he started the Oranje's 3–0 friendly win over Japan, on 5 September 2009. He had previously been capped twice for the under-21 side. and he represented the Netherlands at the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship.
