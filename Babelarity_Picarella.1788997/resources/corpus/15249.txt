Martin Albrechtsen (born 31 March 1980) is a Danish professional football player, currently playing for the Danish superliga team Brøndby IF. He can play in any position across the back four and has played four games for the Danish national team. He is the older brother of Jacob Albrechtsen.
Born in Værløse in the Capital Region of Denmark, Albrechtsen started his career at Akademisk Boldklub (AB). Alongside later Danish international Peter Løvenkrands, he was called up for the Danish under-19 national team in September 1997. In February 1998 they both signed their first professional contracts with AB, joining the senior squad which competed in the Danish Superliga championship. In the 1998-99 season, he scored 1 league goal in 9 games for tAB, while the following season he scores one goal in 31 league games.
Albrechtsen was a part of the AB team which won the 1999 Danish Cup, and he was named 2000 Danish under-21 Talent of the Year. He made his debut for the Denmark national football team under national team manager Morten Olsen in April 2001. As AB struggled financially, Albrechtsen was sold to defending Superliga champions F.C. Copenhagen (FCK) in a DKK 9 million transfer deal in January 2002.
Albrechtsen signed a 4½-year contract with Copenhagen, looking to replace former team captain Jacob Laursen in the central defence. In total he played 14 league games for Løverne in the latter part of the 2001-02-season, while he made 27 league matches in 2002-03. He helped the club.win the 2003 and 2004 Danish Superliga championships, as well as the 2004 Danish Cup trophy. His performances for the club led to two additional national team matches, but after an unimpressive effort during the 0–2 loss to Bosnia and Herzegovina in April 2003, his national team career went on a hiatus. He made his debut for the club on 3 March 2002 when they played 0–0 against AGF. Albrechtsen made his first European appearance for Copenhagen on 27 November 2003 when they drew 1–1 at Mallorca in a match in the UEFA Cup.
In June 2004, he moved abroad to play for English club West Bromwich Albion in the FA Premier League. He was bought in a £2.5 million transfer deal, making him the most expensive player the club had ever bought at that point. He made his debut for the club on 28 August 2004, coming on as a substitute in a Premiership match against Everton. Albrechtsen was a regular for Albion during 2004–05, helping them to avoid relegation on the final day of the season. He also figured prominently during the following season, and scored his first ever goal for the club in the 1–0 win against Wigan Athletic at the JJB Stadium in January 2006. He stayed with the club as Albion were relegated to the secondary English Football League in the summer 2006, and he scored his second goal for the club against Leeds United in September 2006. After an absence of more than three years, he was recalled for the Danish national team in November 2006.
Despite being signed as a central-defender, Albrechtsen had, prior to the 2007–08 season, been utilised mainly as a full-back. In August 2007 however, Albion manager Tony Mowbray decided to move the Danish player back into the centre of defence. Albrechtsen made his 100th appearance for Albion in the 1–0 defeat at Sheffield United on 25 August 2007.
After failing to agree terms with West Brom on a new deal, Albrechsten joined Derby County on a Bosman free transfer, signing a two-year contract with the club on 30 June 2008. In the process he became manager Paul Jewell's eighth signing of the season. Albrechtsen made his debut for Derby in a 1–0 home defeat to Doncaster Rovers on the opening day of the 2008–09 season, and in September scored his first goal for the club, against Cardiff City and netted his second in the next match, a 2–0 win at Q.P.R.. Albrechtsen's fine start to his Derby career saw him nominated for the September Championship Player of the Month award, though he lost out to Reading's Kevin Doyle. The following month he underwent a hernia operation and kept him away from first team action for around a month. On his return from injury, he slotted back into the defence and on 18 February he played in his 300th career league game against Blackpool at Pride Park. He quickly fell out of favour with new manager Nigel Clough, however, and his contract at the club was cancelled by mutual consent on 30 August 2009. After a few days joining FC Midtjylland, Albrechtsen revealed the motives behind his decision to part ways with Derby County. He claimed to have been annoyed at being handed a number of fines by Clough for breaches of club rules like doing interviews without permission.
After being released from Derby County, FC Midtjylland announced the club have signed FC Midtjylland on a free transfer and returned to Denmark after spending 5 years in England. Following his move, Albrechtsen was given a number 5 shirt. Albrechtsen made his debut in a FC Midtjylland shirt against FC Nordsjælland on 12 September 2009 in a 2–0 loss. Albrechtsen scored his first goal for the club against Aalborg BK in a 3–2 win on 2 May 2010. In his first season, Albrechtsen made 21 appearance and scoring 1. In his second season, Albrechtsen scored his first of the season against Silkeborg IF in a 2–1 win on 27 November 2010 and scored his second of the season against F.C. Copenhagen in a 5–2 loss on 19 May 2011. Albrechtsen made 20 appearance and scoring 2.
He signed an one-year-long contract with Brøndby IF on 15 August 2012. On 2 April 2013 the contract was renewed for another two years.
