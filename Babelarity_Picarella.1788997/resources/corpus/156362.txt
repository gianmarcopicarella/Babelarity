Petrovo (Serbian Cyrillic: Петрово) is a town and relatively young municipality located in northern Bosnia and Herzegovina, part of the Republika Srpska entity. The municipality was formed from parts of the pre-war municipalities of Gračanica and Lukavac (the other parts of the pre-war municipalities are now in the other Bosnian entity of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina).
The municipality is close to Doboj just a half way between Doboj and Tuzla. It is located on the mountain Ozren.
The municipality was formed by Bosnian Serb authorities during the war. Bosnian government never recognised this decision and officially municipality was created after the signing of the Dayton Agreement. Bosnian serb authorities also changed the name of the municipality to Petrovo from Bosansko Petrovo Selo. The municipality existed before, however, was dismantled in the 1960s. It belonged to Gračanica and Lukavac as well.
