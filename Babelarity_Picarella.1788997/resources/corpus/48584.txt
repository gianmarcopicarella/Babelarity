The national flag of Algeria (Arabic: علم الجزائر, Berber: Acenyal n Dzayer) consists of two equal vertical bars, green and white, charged in the center with a red star and crescent. The white color represents peace; the green represents Islam; the red, the blood of those killed fighting for independence in the Algerian War (1954 to 1962) and the star and crescent represent Islam.
The flag was adopted on 3 July 1962. A similar version was used by the Algerian government in exile from 1958–1962.
The flag's design is derived from the standard of Emir Abdel Kadir in the 19th century which consisted of two equal vertical bands, green and white, as well as being inspired from the flag of the Algerian Regency from the 16th to the 19th century, which consisted of a white crescent and star on a red background (the same as the modern flag of Turkey; the Algerian Regency was an autonomous vassal of the Ottoman Empire).
Algerian ships fly the national flag as their ensign, except for ships of the Algerian National Navy, which use the national flag charged with two white crossed anchors in the canton as the naval ensign. Formerly, the two crossed anchors in the canton were red.
The Western blazon is per pale Vert and Argent; a crescent and star Gules.
Unlike many African flags, the features of the flag are set down precisely, being described as:
The green must be a composition of equal yellow and blue having, according to the diagram of contrasts of Rood, a wavelength of 5.411 and the position 600 on the normal spectre. The red must be pure, of primary non-decomposable colour, and exempt of blue and yellow having, according to the above-indicated diagram, a wavelength of 6.562 and the position 285 on the normal spectre.
