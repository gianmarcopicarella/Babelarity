At the 2012 World Championships, Asada placed fourth in the short program and sixth in the free skating, finishing sixth overall with 164.52 points.
After a disappointing sixth at the 2012 World Championships, her mother's death, and vexation of learning to jump again, Asada was considering not to compete. Upon visiting her choreographer Lori Nichol on May 2012 for an exhibition number, Asada realized that she still liked skating.
Asada began the 2012–13 season at the Japan Open, performing to Swan Lake.

After winning the World Championship title, Asada stated that there is a 50-50 chance she will continue her career. On 19 May 2014, Asada announced she intends to skip the next season. Asada said she is mentally and physically tired and wants a chance to focus on other aspects of her life, including attending university.
On May 18, 2015, Asada announced her intention to make comeback in competitive skating after having taken a one-year break. She had resumed training with coach Nobuo Satou with the aim of returning to competition. Her first competitive performance of the 2015–16 season was at the 2015 Japan Open, where her first-place skate to Madama Butterfly led Team Japan to a first-place finish.
For the 2015–16 season Grand Prix series, Asada was assigned to compete at 2015 Cup of China and 2015 NHK Trophy. In Cup of China, she landed both her triple axels and placed first overall, winning the short program and placing third in the free skate. She went on to the 2015 NHK Trophy and won the bronze after several problems with her jumping passes. Asada's Grand Prix results qualified her to compete at the 2015–16 Grand Prix Final, where she finished sixth.
Asada went on to win bronze at the 2015–16 Japan Championships. She was selected to compete at both the 2016 Four Continents Championships and 2016 World Championships, though she opted to skip the former in order to focus on the latter. In April 2016, Asada finished seventh at worlds.
Asada is known for her flexibility in spins and spirals. During her first two years on the international scene, Asada became known for her signature move, the cross-grab Biellmann position. She is also noted for performing the one-handed Biellmann spin in competition. She has received +2.60 grade of execution for her spiral sequence. Asada is also known for the complexity of her footwork sequence and has earned +2.00 grade of execution.
Asada landed her first triple axel jump at the age of 12, and she became the first lady to perform a triple-triple-triple combination in national competition, which was a triple flip-triple loop-triple toe loop combination. At the age of 14, Asada landed a triple axel in her free skating program at the 2004–05 Junior Grand Prix Final, held in December 2004 at Helsinki, Finland, becoming the first junior girl to do one in an international event. She has since been known for her triple axel jumps.
Starting with the 2007–08 season, criteria for judging jump take-off and landing technique were made more rigorous, and Asada began to be penalized for under-rotating her jumps and for change-of-edge errors on her Lutz jump, colloquially called a "flutz."
Asada did not include salchow jumps in her junior and senior career programs until 2008. She had stated previously that the triple salchow was the first triple jump she had ever landed and that she did not have a problem landing it cleanly, but she was not comfortable using the jump in competition because it is one of her least favorite jumps. Asada added the triple salchow to her free skating program in the 2008 NHK Trophy and 2008–09 Grand Prix Final.
Normally, Asada uses a triple loop jump as her second jump in a combination, especially after the triple flip. However, she added the toe loop to her free skating as the second jump of her first triple-triple combination during the 2004–05 season, a triple flip-triple toe loop. In the 2006–07 season she used the double axel-triple toe, while in the 2007–08 season she performed the triple flip-triple toe loop again.
In the 2008–09 season, she executed the triple axel-double toe loop combination in international competition, first getting full credit for it at the 2008–09 Grand Prix Final. At that same competition, Asada became the first female skater to land two triple axels in the same program. She is also the only woman to have landed three triple axel jumps in the same competition at an ISU competition. She has a Guinness World Record for the most triple axels performed by a female skater in competition.
After finishing second in 2010 Winter Olympics, Asada decided on the drastic measure of reworking her jumps. The goal was a more fluid jump by adding speed to the approach run, which would increase the height of jumps and the speed of spins. Asada also corrected her habit of moving her shoulders up and down before making a jump. The reworking process set her back for two seasons. Asada found that her jumping began to suffer and she was making mistakes on all her jumps. During the 2012-13 season, her performance improved and she went on a winning streak. Her component score, which had mostly remained in the 7 range, edged above 8. By the 2013-14 season, Asada said, "every single one of my skating techniques had been changed." In 2014 Winter Olympics - Ladies Free Skating event, Asada had executed all six different types of triple jumps.
Asada has been known to practice and land quadruple jumps in training. She credits training alongside Takahiko Kozuka for improving her spins. The number of rotations she is able to achieve with one kick increased from 30 to 104.

Asada originally trained in Japan, but left for the U.S. in August 2006 to train with Rafael Arutyunyan in Lake Arrowhead, California. There she was able to escape the overcrowding of Japanese rinks and the pressure of the Japanese media. Before 2008 Four Continents Championships, she split with Arutyunyan and returned to Japan to practice on the new Aurora Rink at Chukyo University, where she does not have any problems getting ice time. She went to Worlds, and won, without a coach.
During the summer of 2007, Asada received additional training in Russia from Tatiana Tarasova, while Arutyunyan remained her primary coach. The following summer, after leaving Arutyunyan, Asada returned to Russia, and formally decided to be coached by Tarasova. However, their cooperation was hampered by Tarasova's health problems and Asada trained mostly in Nagoya, Japan, with her assistant Jeanetta Folle; in February 1, 2010, Asada indicated she had not been coached by Tarasova since the 2009 Cup of Russia in October. Tarasova was present with Asada at the 2010 Olympics but after the event, Asada chose to be based in her hometown Nagoya and parted ways with Tarasova.
On June 17, 2010, Asada announced that her new jump coach was Hiroshi Nagakubo. In September 2010, Nobuo Sato became Asada's new coach and Asada ended her relationship with coach Nagakubo.
Asada is very popular in Japan and is credited with increasing the popularity of figure skating in Japan. She began to draw attention while still on the junior circuit and is a household name in Japan, known by the affectionate nickname "Mao-chan". During the 2014 Winter Olympics, Asada became the most discussed and mentioned athlete of the Olympics on the social networking website Twitter, ahead of Kim Yuna, ice hockey player T. J. Oshie, and snowboarder Shaun White.

The Asada sisters have also been named as goodwill ambassadors to Canada, and have traveled to Canada to serve in that role.
In 2011, Asada launched her own kimono brand named MaoMao. In January 2012, Asada cancelled the release of a book on her skating career; she stated, "The way the book was advertised was different from what I had in mind."
Asada has appeared in many variety television shows as well as in commercials. She and her dog Aero, named after Aero chocolates, have been featured in chocolate commercials in Japan. Asada's sponsors include Coca Cola, Itoham Foods, Kao, Lotte, Nestlé, Oji Paper Company, Olympus Corporation, Omron, Sato Pharmaceutical, United Airlines, and Weider.

During the 2010 Winter Olympics, a popular Vancouver Japanese street food vendor, Japadog, named a hot dog after Asada called the Mao Dog. Similarly, a local sushi store created a sushi roll and named it the Mao Roll after Asada. After Asada's silver medal win, Japanese dollmaker Kyugetsu created a Mao Asada hina doll in celebration of her efforts. In December 2013, chrysanthemum farmers in the Ryukyu Islands named a new crop of chrysanthemums "Mao Orange" after the colour of Asada's short program dress from the 2012–13 season.
On April 8, 2014, Asada's exhibition named "Smile" opened at Takashimaya department store in Tokyo's Nihonbashi district. This drew more than 10,000 visitors on its first day, outperforming every other event opening at the establishment for the past 10 years. In just nine days, it hit more than 100,000 visitors, the shortest period to reach the milestone in Takashimaya's history. The exhibition includes a collection of 30 costumes that were worn by Asada and a display of medals she has won over the years, among them the silver she scooped up at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics.
On July 5, 2014, Asada made her debut as a reporter for the long-running travel program “Sekai Fushigi Hakken!” by TBS. For this documentary, she traveled Austria, Slovakia and Hungary for eight days to find the origin of figure skating. In March 2015, Asada made her debut as DJ host for her weekly radio show program "Mao Asada's Nippon Smile". This program was sponsored by Sumitomo Life Insurance Ltd. Co. and aired in TBS radio from March 2015 to June 2015.
She is also a big fan of Japanese pop star Ayumi Hamasaki, and was seen congratulating her on her 10th Anniversary. Asada is frequently referred to in French media as the 'goddaughter' of figure skater Philippe Candeloro, who has called himself her 'godfather'.
