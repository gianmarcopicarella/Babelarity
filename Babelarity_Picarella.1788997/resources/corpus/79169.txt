The following is an overview of events in 1984 in film, including the highest-grossing films, award ceremonies and festivals, a list of films released and notable deaths. The year's highest-grossing film was Beverly Hills Cop. Ghostbusters overtook it, however, with a re-release the following year. Other popular films included The Neverending Story, which was the most expensive film produced in West Germany, The Karate Kid and Romancing the Stone. A high number of sci-fi/fantasy films were released in 1984.
The top ten 1984 released films by box office gross in North America are as follows:
The Walt Disney Studios establishes Touchstone Pictures to release films with more mature subject matter than the traditional Walt Disney Pictures banner.
Tri-Star Pictures, a joint venture of Columbia Pictures, HBO, and CBS, releases its first film.
Michael Eisner becomes head of Walt Disney Productions, while Frank Wells became chief operating officer and Jeffrey Katzenberg was named chairman.
Prince's first film Purple Rain is released.
Annie's Coming Out wins AFI Award (Australia)
The Motion Picture Association of America institutes the PG-13 rating, as a response to violent movies such as Gremlins and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.
Romancing the Stone is released and propelled stars Kathleen Turner, Michael Douglas, and Danny DeVito and director Robert Zemeckis to super-stardom. The film also gave Zemeckis his first box office hit, which gave Universal Pictures confidence to allow him to direct his next film, Back to the Future.
