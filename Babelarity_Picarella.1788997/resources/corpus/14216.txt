The 1993 Canadian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal, Canada on 13 June 1993. The 69-lap race was the seventh round of the 1993 Formula One season. It was won by Williams driver Alain Prost, who consequently retook the lead in the Drivers' Championship and would not surrender it again. Michael Schumacher finished second for the Benetton team, in front of Prost's team-mate Damon Hill who completed the podium.
There was a two by two formation in qualifying in Canada as the Williams were ahead of the Benettons and the Ferraris. Prost took pole ahead of Hill, Schumacher, Patrese, Berger and Alesi. Uncharacteristically, Senna was down in 8th.
At the start, Hill beat Prost away, while the Benettons were slow and were passed by Berger and Senna (who had already got ahead of Brundle and then Alesi). Hill was leading Prost, Berger, Senna, Schumacher and Patrese.
Senna passed Berger for third on lap 2. On lap 6, Prost took the lead from Hill. Soon afterwards, Schumacher passed Berger with Patrese following him through five laps later. The order stabilised at: Prost, Hill, Senna, Schumacher, Patrese and Berger.
During the mid-race stops, Hill had a problem and dropped behind Senna and Schumacher. Schumacher now set off after Senna. Senna suffered an electrical problem and had to retire. Prost won ahead of Schumacher, Hill, Berger, Brundle and Wendlinger.
This is the last race on which 1976 Formula One champion James Hunt commentated for Grand Prix for the BBC. He died barely 48 hours after the race.
Note: Only the top five positions are included for both sets of standings.
