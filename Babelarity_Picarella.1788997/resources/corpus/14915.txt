Horst Hrubesch (born 17 April 1951) is a retired German football player, now manager, employed as of 2012 as a youth trainer at the German Football Association. His nickname was Das Kopfball-Ungeheuer (the Header Beast) for his heading skills.
Hrubesch was the typical late bloomer. He played in small clubs until the age of 24 before he was signed by Rot-Weiss Essen. There he played well enough that in 1978 Hamburger SV (HSV) bought him, where he blossomed into one of the most productive forwards of the Bundesliga with 96 goals in only 159 matches and was soon called up for the West German national team. Hrubesch was known for his symbiotic relationship with fellow HSV player Manfred Kaltz, a right wingback whose crosses Hrubesch often headed into the goal.
West Germany's match-winning hero in the UEFA Euro 1980 Final against Belgium, Hrubesch scored two goals in Rome, the second of them a trademark bullet header in the 89th minute. It was a day of glorious redemption for the big, bulky Hamburger SV centre forward who a few weeks earlier had hobbled around the field with an ankle injury as his club lost the European Champion Clubs' Cup final to Nottingham Forest FC. A latecomer to the international scene, Hrubesch had only been called into the West Germany squad after Klaus Fischer broke his leg, and the game against Belgium was only his fifth international appearance. He would win just 21 caps in all, the last of them in the 1982 FIFA World Cup final. A German champion three times, he also won the European Cup with Hamburg in 1983, captaining the team to a sensational 1–0 win against favourites Juventus in the Athens final.
His greatest successes were the win of the European Championship in 1980, where he decided the finals with two of his late Ungeheuer header goals, and 1983, where he won the Champions Cup against Juventus. He also was German champion in 1979, 1982 and 1983. He scored 136 goals in 224 games in the Bundesliga and was capped 21 times.
He is also famous for having scored the winning penalty which knocked France out of the 1982 FIFA World Cup semi-finals after an epic game which was tied 3–3 after extra-time. Irish television commentator Jimmy Magee during the shoot-out coined the phrase that made Hrubesch best known in the English-speaking world: "The man they call 'The Monster'."
Hrubesch started his coaching career with Rot-Weiss Essen He was there between 1 July 1986 and 14 September 1987. His first match was a 2–0 loss against Rot-Weiß Oberhausen on 25 July 1986. He had won two of nine league matches and a first round exit from the cup before leaving the club. His final match was a 3–1 loss to Rot-Weiß Oberhausen on 13 September 1987. He won 16 of his 47 league matches. Hrubesch then took over VfL Wolfsburg for the 1988–89 season. In the cup, he had a draw and a loss. This includes a 1–1 draw and a 6–1 loss against to Eintracht Frankfurt. Hrubesch then took over Swarovski Tirol from 1 January 1992 to 30 June 1992. His first match was a 2–0 win against Austria Salzburg. Hrubesch took over at Hansa Rostock between 4 January 1993 and 26 June 1993. His first match was a 3–0 loss to Waldhof Mannheim on 6 February 1993. Hrubesch took over as head coach of Dynamo Dresden on 22 November 1994 and was there until 1 March 1995. He failed to win any of his five matches. His first match was a 1–1 draw against Karlsruher SC on 26 November 1994. Dynamo Dresden also lost a 2–1 to Bayern Munich, 1–1 draw against Bayer Leverkusen, 1–0 loss to Werder Bremen, and a 2–0 loss to VfL Bochum. Hrubesch was head coach of Austria Wien for the 1995–96 season. His first match was a 4–0 win against Vorwärts Steyr on 2 August 1995. Hrubesch was head coach of Samsunspor for the 1997–98 season. Samsunspor finished second in Group 6 of the UEFA Intertoto Cup, three points behind Hamburger SV. Their record was three wins and a loss. In the league, they finished with a record of 14 wins, seven draws, and 13 losses in 34 matches.
Hrubesch was head coach of Germany's B team from 22 March 1999. He was appointed assistant coach of Germany's A team on 8 May 2000. The coaching staff was reconstructed on 26 March 2002 with Uli Stielike becoming the new head coach of Germany's B team. In 2008, Hrubesch won the European Championship with the Germany U–19 team. On 9 January 2009, Hrubesch was named interim coach of the Germany U–21 team. Rainer Adrion was unavailable to become the permanent head coach until the summer. In June 2009, he guided Germany to the final of the 2009 UEFA Under-21 Championships where they defeated England Under 21's by 4–0. On 11 November 2009, it was announced that he will begin to work as U-19 coach of the DFB. He returned to the Germany U–21 team after Rainer Adrion was sacked on 21 June 2013.
