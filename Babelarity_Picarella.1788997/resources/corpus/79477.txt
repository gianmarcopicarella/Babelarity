Christy Canyon (born June 17, 1966) is retired pornographic actress and American radio personality. She is an inductee of the AVN and XRCO Hall of Fame.
Canyon has performed in over 100 adult films and effectively retired from performing in front of the camera three times, as she shot films from September 1984 to March 1985; June 1989 to December 1992; and 1995 to 1997 (as an exclusive/contract performer for Vivid).
In her autobiography, Canyon stated that porn actor Greg Rome approached her while she was waiting for a ride in Hollywood, and told her that she would be a terrific figure model. He gave her the business card of adult magazine and film recruiter/agent Jim South, of World Modeling Agency. After visiting South's office she posed for men's magazines and began her video career shortly thereafter. She has stated that her first on-screen performance was with Ronald "Ron" Jeremy (Hyatt) in 1984's "Swedish Erotica 57," and that Jeremy soon became a close friend in the business.
In a 2005 interview on Taylor Wane's radio show, Canyon stated that on-camera she had protected sex (with condoms) with all of her male co-stars during her time with Vivid Entertainment in the mid-1990s.
From 2005 to March 2011, she was co-host of Sirius XM Satellite Radio's Playboy Radio show Night Calls. As of April 2011 she became co-host of Sirius XM Satellite Radio's Spice Sex Circus with Ginger Lynn and sole host of Sirius XM Satellite Radio's weekly Legends of Porn. She co-hosted Radio Sex You Porn on Sirius/XM Channel 102, until October 2013 when the channel went off the air. In December 2013, she became the host of The Christy Canyon Show on Vivid Radio on Sirius/XM Channel 102.
Canyon is retired from performing in adult films and dancing on the road, but she still has an adult-related career, concentrating on her web site, working as a host for Vivid Radio and selling merchandise on eBay and ABIBIDS. In 2003, she published her autobiography, titled Lights, Camera, Sex (ISBN 0-9727470-0-1), which is still in print. In November 2005, she appeared as a judge on the first season of Jenna's American Sex Star.
The ABC News show ABC News Nightline featured Canyon in a 2010 interview, in a segment titled Porn: When the Camera Stops as part of the series Modern Sex in America.
Canyon has won several "best female performance"-type awards and is a member of both the XRCO and AVN Halls of Fame.
Canyon was born in California to an Armenian-American father and an Italian-American mother. She has been married and divorced three times and is the mother of two adopted children.
