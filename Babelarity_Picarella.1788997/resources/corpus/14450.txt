Bruno Uvini Bortolança (born 3 June 1991) is a Brazilian footballer who plays as a centre back for Napoli in the Serie A.
Uvini was born in Capivari, Brazil. He played in the Pinta de Craque football academy owned by his father, Bruno Uvini, known by Tuca, a former central defender at Ponte Preta, before moving to PAEC's youth system.
Uvini joined São Paulo FC's youth academy in 2007, aged 16. He was promoted to the club's senior side in 2010, and made his professional debut on 29 September 2010, coming on as a late substitute in a 2–4 loss at Grêmio, and also appeared in one further more game (again from the bench) in the season.
In 2011 Uvini appeared in six matches with Tricolor, being handed his first start on 26 June, in a 0–5 loss at Corinthians.
On 14 February 2012, Tottenham Hotspur agreed to sign signed Bruno Uvini on loan until the end of 2011–12 season, with an option to make the move permanent for €3.7 million. Uvini failed to live up to expectations at Tottenham and the club opted not to sign him on a permanent basis. He left without making a first-team appearance for the London-based club.
On 29 August 2012, it was reported that Uvini was having a medical with Serie A club Napoli, signing a five-year deal a day later. On 6 December he made his debut for the club, starting in a 1–3 home loss against PSV Eindhoven, for the season's UEFA Europa League.

On 30 March 2014 Uvini returned to Brazil, joining Santos on loan until the end of the year. He made his debut on 9 May, starting and playing 76 minutes in a 2–1 Copa do Brasil win at Princesa do Solimões.
On 18 July, Uvini scored his first professional goal, netting the first of a 2–0 home win against Palmeiras.
On 13 July 2015, Uvini signed a season long loan for Dutch side FC Twente .
Uvini captained the Brazil U20 team in the 2011 South American Youth Championships. On 6 February 2011, Uvini suffered a fractured fibula in a match against Argentina which required surgery and kept him out of action for more than a month. Later in 2011, he captained the Brazilian side that won the U20 World Cup. In May 2012 he was called for main squad to friendly matches, and in July 2012 Uvini was called to play 2012 Olympic Games.
