The history of Aporé begins in the twentieth century near a site where a village, Arraial do Corrente, already existed. With the decadence of this settlement rancher João Nunes founded a settlement nearby on the banks of the Aporé River. Lands were donated to erect a chapel to the Divino Espírito Santo and a bridge was built over the river, allowing communications with Mato Grosso. In 1938 the first houses appeared and the village was named Aporé after the river, a name which means "river of fish". In 1958 Aporé became a municipality.
