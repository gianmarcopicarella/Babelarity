The last few decades have been a period of rapid progress for the town, especially its tourism. There are still plenty of traditional rural occupations, but also many kinds of commercial activities. Nilsiä has become the administrative and commercial centre of Northeast Savonia and it co-operates actively with the city of Kuopio. The services in Nilsiä are as diverse as in many larger towns.
Nilsiä has exceptionally much to offer to those who love sports and nature, whether it is winter or summer. Tahkovuori is a popular winter sport centre. There are also marked routes for snowmobile trainers.
In summer there are many marked paths for hiking and mountain biking. There is a marina and good fishing possibilities in lakes Syväri and Vuotjärvi, like in the Lastukoski rapids, too.
Nilsiä is also a well-known golf centre.
Nilsiä joined the city of Kuopio at the beginning of year 2013.
