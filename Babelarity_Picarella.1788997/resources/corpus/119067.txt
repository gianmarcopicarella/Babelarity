234 Barbara is a main belt asteroid that was discovered by German-American astronomer Christian Heinrich Friedrich Peters on August 12, 1883 in Clinton, New York. It is classified as a stony S-type asteroid based upon its spectrum. The mean diameter is estimated as 45.6 km.
Polarimetric study of this asteroid reveals anomalous properties that suggests the regolith consists of a mixture of low and high albedo material. This may have been caused by fragmentation of an asteroid substrate with the spectral properties of CO3/CV3 carbonaceous chondrites.
Observations made in 2009 with ESO's Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) suggested that 234 Barbara may be a binary asteroid, although a paper published in 2015 states that "the VLTI observations can be explained without the presence of a large satellite"
