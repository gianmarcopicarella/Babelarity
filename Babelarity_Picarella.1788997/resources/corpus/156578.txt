Šamorín (Slovak pronunciation: [ˈʃamoriːn]; Hungarian: Somorja, German: Sommerein) is a small Hungarian town in western Slovakia, southeast of Bratislava (Pozsony).
The town is located on the Danubian Flat on the Žitný ostrov island, near the Gabčíkovo dam on the Danube. It is located around 17 kilometres (11 miles) southeast of Bratislava and 25 kilometres (16 miles) west of Dunajská Streda. Administratively, the town belongs to the Trnava Region, Dunajská Streda District.
The small Hungarian town was mentioned for the first time in 1238 as ecclesia Sancte Mariae and was a prominent port on the Danube during the Middle Ages. Agriculture also played a major role in the town's development. As a result of this prosperity, its citizens enjoyed a brisk trade in the new technologies and many shipyards on the Danube. However, with rise of Pressburg (now Bratislava, hu: Pozsony), the importance of the town began declining. Šamorín eventually lost its right to the status of royal free city granted in 1405 during the reign of Hungarian King Sigismund. In the sixteenth century, the city became notable again because of the witch trials held there. After the Austro-Hungarian army disintegrated in November 1918, Czechoslovak troops unlawfully occupied the area, later acknowledged internationally (contested by Hungary) by the Treaty of Trianon. Between 1938 and 1945 Šamorín (Somorja) once more became part of Miklós Horthy's Hungary through the First Vienna Award. From 1945 until the Velvet Divorce, it was part of Czechoslovakia. Since then it has been part of Slovakia.
