Floydada is a city in and the county seat of Floyd County, Texas, United States. This rural community lies on the high plains of the Llano Estacado in West Texas and is sometimes referred to as the Pumpkin Capital of Texas. The population was 3,676 at the 2000 census.
According to the Texas State Historical Association, the community of Floydada was originally named Floyd City. It was established in 1890 on 640 acres (260 ha) of land donated by James B. and Caroline Price of Jefferson City, Missouri. Floydada won the election as county seat over Della Plain. When a post office opened, the name was changed to Floydada. The meaning of the name is disputed. Some claim it was meant to be Floydalia but was garbled in transmission to Washington, while others insist it is a combination of the county's name and that James Price's mother, Ada. A third view is that it was formed from Caroline Price's parents, Floyd and Ada.
Floydada became an important railroad junction in 1928, when the Quanah, Acme and Pacific Railway reached the town.

Floydada has a number of free training programs provided by the Floydada Professional Development Center and the Floydada Economic Development Corporation (EDC). Employers can access financial assistance for training through the Skills Development Fund and the Self-Sufficiency Fund administered by the Texas Workforce Commission. Local training facilities include Caprock Community Action and the Floydada Technology Center.
The Floydada Technology Center (FTC) began in 2003 and is provided by the Floydada EDC and is housed in the EDC offices at 105 South 5th Street. The Center itself was designed to provide workforce development to both citizens and businesses upon request. It houses a twelve student capacity classroom with an instructor's podium and computer that is attached to a projector. Caprock Community Action was opened in 2002 and operates a learning lab that offers citizens the opportunity to earn their GED. They are located at 701 E. Lee Street.
Archaeologists from Wichita State University excavated in Blanco Canyon, 5 mi (8.0 km) south of Floydada. They discovered significant evidence that Spanish explorer Francisco Vásquez de Coronado established a major camp there during his search for Quivira, one of the legendary Seven Cities of Gold. The Floyd County Historical Museum in downtown Floydada displays some of the significant artifacts from Coronado's campsite. There is also an historical marker in Blanco Canyon telling of Coronado's expedition which led through said canyon.
Floydada is located in what many call the wind corridor of the United States. The wind corridor stretches from the Texas Panhandle up into Minnesota, including some of the most wind rich states in the country.
The region is ideal for wind development because of its wind quality, the potential to connect into two different electric grid systems, and the plan scheduled for transmission build-out in the area.
The quality of wind is ranked on a scale of one to seven. In Floyd County the wind ranking is class 4, which is considered good for wind energy development. Texas is served by several electric grid operators. Those operating in the Floyd County area are Southwest Power Pool (SPP) and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). It is beneficial for the area to be in such close vicinity to both grids because it allows for the opportunity to send electricity generated from wind farms either direction. Even though Floyd County is located primarily in the SPP grid, lines can be built in the area that connect to the ERCOT grid. In January 2009 the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) chose several transmission service providers (TSPs) to construct a build-out of transmission lines across the State of Texas. The purpose of the transmission overhaul was to help harness the wind rich regions of West Texas and the Texas Panhandle in order to send the energy generated into more populated areas of Texas where the energy can be used. Two TSPs have Floyd County included in their study area, Sharyland Utilities and Wind Energy Transmission Texas (WETT). The Competitive Renewable Energy Zones (CREZ) project in Texas has the potential to help spur wind energy development in Floyd County. Xcel Energy is also making plans to construct a transmission line through Floyd County.
The region's economy is based on agriculture, but local companies provide services such as custom-built metal assembly irrigation motor development, efficient rock crushing systems, and a product called "The Row Stalker."
