Galinsoga parviflora is an herbaceous plant in the Asteraceae (daisy) family. It has several common names including guasca (Colombia), mielcilla (Costa Rica), galinsoga (NZ), gallant soldier (UK)/(USA), and potato weed.
It is also known by the taxonomic name Tridax parviflora
Galinsoga parviflora was brought from Peru to Kew Gardens in 1796, and later escaped to the wild in Great Britain and Ireland. In Britain its name Galinsoga is sometimes popularly rendered as "gallant soldiers", and then sometimes altered to "soldiers of the Queen".
In Colombia it is used as a spice herb in the soup Ajiaco. It can also be used as an ingredient in leaf salads.
In much of the world it is considered a weed.
Galinsoga parviflora grows to a height of 75 cm (30 inches). It is a branched herb with opposite stalked leaves, toothed at the margins. The flowers are in small heads. The 3-8 white ray-florets are about 1 mm (0.4 inches) long and 3-lobed. The central disc florets are yellow and tubular.
There are a few records of G. parviflora and G. ciliata as a weed in Northern Ireland.
