The 2001 Wimbledon Championships was a tennis tournament played on the outdoor grass courts at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in Wimbledon, London, England. It was the 115th edition of the Wimbledon Championships and was held from 25 June to 9 July 2001. The tournament was part of the 2001 ATP and WTA Tours.
The tournament was the first in Wimbledon's 124-year history in which 32 players in the men's and women's draws were seeded, instead of the usual sixteen. This move was made to appease clay court players unhappy with the traditional seeding system, which weighs grass court results over those of other surfaces.
Pete Sampras was unsuccessful in his defence of the men's singles title, losing to then little-known 19-year-old Roger Federer in the fourth round. Goran Ivanišević won the title, defeating 2000 runner-up Patrick Rafter in the final in five sets. Ivanišević had previously been runner-up three times (1992, 1994 and 1998), but had fallen to number 125 in the world by 2001 and had only entered the tournament after being granted a wildcard. Venus Williams was successful in her defence of the women's singles title, beating 19-year-old Justine Henin in the final in three sets. Henin became the first Belgian player to reach a Wimbledon final. Martina Hingis, the top seed, was beaten by Virginia Ruano Pascual in the first round.
 Goran Ivanišević defeated  Pat Rafter, 6–3, 3–6, 6–3, 2–6, 9–7.
It was Ivanišević's 1st title of the year, and his 22nd (and last) overall. It was his only career Grand Slam title.
This was Ivanišević's fourth Wimbledon final and Rafter's second. Ivanišević became the first wildcard, the first Croatian and the lowest ranked player in history (world No. 125) to claim the Wimbledon title. He was also the first Croatian male tennis player to win the Grand Slam final.
 Venus Williams defeated  Justine Henin, 6–1, 3–6, 6–0 
It was Williams' 3rd title of the year, and her 18th overall. It was her 3rd career Grand Slam title, and her 2nd at Wimbledon.
Henin became the first Belgian player (male or female) to reach the Wimbledon singles final.
