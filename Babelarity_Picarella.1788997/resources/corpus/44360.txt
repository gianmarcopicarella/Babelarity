The line-up of the band didn't change until 2001, when female lead singer Federica de Boni left the band, with Gustavo Gabarro becoming the new singer. Two years later, other original members Fabio Pozzato and Massimo Faccio left the band as well. In 2006 Elisa de Palma became the new singer, with the band becoming female-fronted once again.
