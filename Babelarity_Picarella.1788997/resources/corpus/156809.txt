Plant City is a city in Hillsborough County, Florida, in the United States, approximately midway between Brandon and Lakeland along Interstate 4. The population was 34,721 at the 2010 census.
Many people believe it was named for the flora (especially vegetables and fruits, as well as tropical houseplants) grown at plant nurseries in its tropical Gulf Coast climate. However, it was actually named after prominent railroad developer Henry B. Plant (see Plant System).
Plant City is known as the winter strawberry capital of the world and hosts the annual Florida Strawberry Festival in the late winter (usually in February or early March), which is attended by people from all over the United States as well as many people from around the world. Wishnatzki Farms, the largest strawberry producer in Florida, has a large presence in Plant City.
Plant City's original name was Ichepucksassa (also known as Idasukshed) after the Indian village that once occupied the territory. Its name caused so much confusion that the city was renamed Cork, after the postmaster's Irish hometown. It was finally given the name Plant City in commemoration of Henry B. Plant and his railroad, which significantly boosted the commerce in this primarily agricultural community by incorporating it with the South Florida Railroad.
The columnist John Keasler, who wrote 7,000 columns over 30 years for The Miami News, hailed from Plant City.
Plant City was also the spring training home of the Cincinnati Reds who played at Plant City Stadium from 1988 to 1997.
The 2012 cult classic film, Rock Bottom Creek was filmed mostly in Plant City.
Plant City is located at 28°1′N 82°8′W (28.0142, -82.1289).
According to the United States Census Bureau the city has a total area of 22.8 square miles (59 km2), of which 22.6 square miles (59 km2) is land and 0.2 square miles (0.52 km2), or 0.53%, is water.
The city and its surrounding area are in the Southern Flatwoods ecological community as defined by the US Department of Agriculture. [1] The region as a whole is noted for its sandy, infertile, and poorly drained soils. In and around Plant City, however, high organic matter content and scattered phosphate nodules make many of the soils more fertile than typical for the flatwoods.
Plant City, as does most of Florida, has a humid subtropical climate with humid and hot summers and warm, drier winters. Since the coolest month mean temperature is 61 °F, it narrowly misses the definition of a true tropical climate.

The east-west ACL tracks cross the north-south Seaboard tracks at a 90 degree angle at the southeast corner of the station. The station has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1975. Amtrak's Silver Star still uses the line west-to-eastbound ACL tracks, although it does not stop there. Closest stations are Tampa or Lakeland. Recently, a train-viewing complex was built at the southwest corner of the diamond.

On October 12, 2009, the Plant City Commissioners voted 4-1 to essentially ban all new murals in the Historic District of Plant City. Current murals being painted are not affected by this ban, but no new murals can be painted unless the owner of the building can prove there was an already existing mural on the wall before 1994. The ban was set in motion by a complaint about a recent mural by Blake Emory- a rendition of Norman Rockwell's "April Fools" - contained a sex organ in the painting. Even though the creators of the mural insisted it was not intentional, and immediately altered the section of the mural, City Commissioners hastily cast the vote adding that they may revisit this ban in the future. City Commissioner Mike Dodson was the only vote against the ban saying he was looking for a more thought out and complete ordinance over an immediate and outright ban.
