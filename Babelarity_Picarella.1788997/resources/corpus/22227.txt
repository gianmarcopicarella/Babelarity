Xenophon of Ephesus (Greek: Ξενοφῶν; fl. 2nd century – 3rd century AD) was a Greek writer. His surviving work is the Ephesian Tale of Anthia and Habrocomes, one of the earliest novels as well as one of the sources for Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.
He is not to be confused with the earlier and more famous Athenian soldier and historian, Xenophon.
Other ancient Greek novelists:
Chariton – The Loves of Chaereas and Callirhoe
Achilles Tatius – Leucippe and Clitophon
Heliodorus of Emesa – The Aethiopica
Longus – Daphnis and Chloe
