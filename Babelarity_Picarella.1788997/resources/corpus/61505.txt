A somma volcano (also known simply as a sommian) is a volcanic caldera that has been partially filled by a new central cone. The name comes from Mount Somma, a stratovolcano in southern Italy with a summit caldera in which the upper cone of Mount Vesuvius has grown.
A number of the world's best examples of somma volcanoes are found on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula and the Kuril Islands that stretch south from Kamchatka to Hokkaidō (Japan).
