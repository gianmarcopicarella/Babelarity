Novak Djokovic was the three-time defending champion, but lost in the quarterfinals to eventual champion Stan Wawrinka, bringing Djokovic's 25-match winning streak at the Australian Open, 28-match winning streak overall and a streak of 14 consecutive Grand Slam semifinals to an end.
Rafael Nadal was going to be the third man trying to complete a double career Grand Slam and also trying to tie Pete Sampras's record of 14 Grand Slam wins. Eighth seed Wawrinka won the title by defeating top seed Nadal in the final, becoming the first man outside of the Big Four to win a Grand Slam since Juan Martin del Potro won the 2009 US Open. He also became the first male player to defeat the top two seeds at a Grand Slam since Sergi Bruguera at the 1993 French Open.
By participating in this tournament, Federer broke the record of consecutive Grand Slam appearances as this was his 57th consecutive appearance at a Major.
