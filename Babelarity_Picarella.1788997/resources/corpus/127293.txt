The Manhattan Life Insurance Building was a 348 ft (106 m) tower at 64-66 Broadway in New York City completed in 1894 to the designs of the architects of Kimball & Thompson and slightly extended north in 1904 making its new address 64-70 Broadway. It was the first skyscraper to pass 330 ft (100 m) in Manhattan.
In 1926, the building was sold by Manhattan Life Insurance Company to Frederick Brown, who then re-sold it to the Manufacturer's Trust Company a few weeks later. Then, in 1928, it was bought by Central Union Trust Company, whose headquarters adjoined the building to the north, for an undisclosed sum, although the building was assessed at that time at $4 million.
The building was demolished to make way for an Annex to the Irving Trust Company Building, now One Wall Street, completed in 1965. Sources vary about whether the year of demolition was 1963 or 1964.
