Sibley was created by Eddie and Edythe Hagglund beginning in 1954, when they observed the popularity of the nearby Lake Ashtabula and decided that a hamburger restaurant would be profitable. Therefore, they purchased some land near the lake and began to erect buildings: a dance hall, the restaurant, and many others. The city was incorporated after a dispute with authorities of Sibley Trail Township: although the Hagglunds wanted a liquor license, the township authorities would not grant one, so the Hagglunds incorporated the city. It was named after Henry Hastings Sibley, a general and the first Governor of Minnesota.
In the 1970s, the Hagglunds sold the majority of the city to others, keeping the core businesses. They retained the business core of the city for many years, even after Eddie's death, but in 2007, Edythe announced the upcoming sale of the remaining parts of the city at auction.
