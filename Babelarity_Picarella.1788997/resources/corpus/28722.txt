The Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) (Arabic: الوكالة العربية السورية للأنباء‎‎ Al-Wakālah al-'Arabīyah as-Sūrīyah al-'Anbā) is a news agency in Syria. It is a public-owned media organization linked to the Ministry of Information. It was established in June 1965.
SANA launched its website in 1997. Up until November 2012, SANA's website was hosted in Dallas, Texas by the United States company SoftLayer. Due to sanctions related to the Syrian Civil War, which make this hosting illegal, the SoftLayer company was obliged to terminate its hosting responsibilities with SANA.
