Chardy won the 2005 Wimbledon Championships Boys' Singles title, and finished as the runner-up at the 2005 US Open Boys' Singles, losing to Ryan Sweeting.
As a junior Chardy compiled a 65–28 singles win/loss record and reached as high as No. 3 in the junior combined world rankings in September 2005.
Chardy made his Grand Slam debut in 2006, receiving a wild card at the French Open, where he beat Jonas Björkman in straight sets in the first round, before losing in four sets to fifteenth-seeded David Ferrer in the second round.
In 2008, after losing the final of the Marrakech Challenger in May to eventual French Open semifinalist Gaël Monfils, Chardy produced his best Grand Slam showing until 2013 at the French Open, where he entered as a wild card and came back in the second round from two-sets-to-love down to defeat World No. 6 David Nalbandian in five sets (only dropping 5 games in the final three sets). He continued his run by beating 30th seed Dmitry Tursunov, before losing in the fourth round to 19th seed Nicolás Almagro in straight sets (Chardy held set points in each of the three sets).
In 2009, he began with a first-round loss in Doha, before reaching the quarterfinals in Sydney, where he fell to Richard Gasquet. At the Australian Open, he fell in the second round to defending champion Novak Djoković.
In his next tournament at Johannesburg, he reached the semifinals, following three straight-sets wins. In the semifinals, he came up against World No. 13 David Ferrer and saved three match points in the second set to win in a final set tiebreak, and reach his first ATP final. Chardy lost in the final to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.
He lost in the opening round of his next tournament, the 2009 Open 13 in Marseille, to Novak Djokovic. In Delray Beach, he was seeded seventh and defeated Tommy Haas, Andrey Golubev and Marcos Baghdatis. He fell in the semifinals to top seed and eventual winner, Mardy Fish.
Chardy frequently plays doubles with compatriot Gilles Simon. They most recently competed at the Monte Carlo Masters together, losing to Nikolay Davydenko and Oliver Marach in the first round.
At Wimbledon, Chardy lost in the first round in four sets to eventual runner-up Andy Roddick.
Next, Chardy played at the MercedesCup in Stuttgart. He defeated José Acasuso, Martín Vassallo Argüello and local hopes Mischa Zverev and Nicolas Kiefer, on the same day to reach his second career final. He triumphed over fourth-seeded Victor Hănescu (after losing the first set 1–6) to clinch his maiden ATP title.
At the beginning of the 2010 season, he started poorly; losing in the first rounds of the Brisbane International, Heineken Open, the Australian Open, and the SAP Open. However, he finally registered his first win in the tour, at the 2010 Regions Morgan Keegan Championships in style, as he beat second seed Fernando Verdasco in the first round. This was arguably his best win to date and only his fourth win against a top-10 player. At the 2010 Rogers Cup, Chardy defeated Verdasco once more in the second round and followed this up with an easy win over sixth-ranked Nikolay Davydenko in the round of 16, before losing to Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals.
In 2011, Chardy played principally in Challenger tournaments, reaching several finals, both in singles and in doubles. He qualified for the Kremlin Cup and reached the semifinals, where he was defeated by Victor Troicki.
In the 2012 Western and Southern Open in Cincinnati, Jérémy Chardy upset the defending champion and Olympic singles gold medalist Andy Murray in straight sets. Murray had easily beaten him the last four times he faced Chardy. Jérémy was defeated by Juan Martin del Potro in the quarterfinals, in straight sets.
Chardy started the year impressively, reaching the quarter-finals of the 2013 Australian Open. Along the way he defeated three seeded players: 30th seed Marcel Granollers (6–3, 3–6, 6–1, 6–2), 6th seed Juan Martin del Potro in five sets (6–3, 6–3, 6–7, 3–6, 6–3), and 21st seed Andreas Seppi from a set down (5–7, 6–3, 6–2, 6–2). In the quarter-finals he was beaten by World No. 2 Andy Murray in straight sets (6–4, 6–1, 6–2). This run propelled Chardy to a career-high singles ranking of World No. 25. He lost in the third round of the French Open, to countryman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. He also lost in the third round of Wimbledon to Novak Djokovic, winning just seven games.
In 2014 Chardy capped off 2014 recording 33 wins & 27 losses, he also registered his 150th career victory at Wimbledon.
