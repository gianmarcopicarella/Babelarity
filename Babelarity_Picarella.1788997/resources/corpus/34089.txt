The needle-clawed bushbabies are the two species in the genus Euoticus, which is in the family Galagidae. Galagidae is sometimes included as a subfamily within the Lorisidae (or Loridae).
Genus Euoticus
Southern needle-clawed bushbaby, Euoticus elegantulus
Northern needle-clawed bushbaby, Euoticus pallidus
Euoticus pallidus pallidus
Euoticus pallidus talboti
Unique to the needle-clawed bushbaby are the keeled nails, featuring prominent central ridges ending in needle-like points, present on all digits except the thumbs, the big toes, and the second foot phalanges which have claws.
The first sample of Euoticus elegantulus to arrive in Europe from Africa was brought by Gerald Durrell. The uncovering of this bush baby is documented in his 1957 book A Zoo in My Luggage.
