Parus is a genus of Old World birds in the tit family. It was formerly a large genus containing most of the 50 odd species in the family Paridae. The genus was split into several resurrected genera following the publication of a detailed molecular phylogenetic analysis in 2013.
The genus now contains the following species:
Great tit, Parus major
Japanese tit, Parus minor (split from P. major)
Cinereous tit, Parus cinereus (split from P. major)
Green-backed tit, Parus monticolus
