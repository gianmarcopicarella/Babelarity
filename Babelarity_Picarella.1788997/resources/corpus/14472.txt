The 1995 Copa América football tournament was staged in Uruguay. It was won by Uruguay, who beat Brazil 5–3 in the penalty shootout after a 1–1 draw in the final. All 10 CONMEBOL members took part, with Mexico and the USA invited in order to reach 12 teams.
The USA were the surprise of the tournament, beating defending champions Argentina 3–0 and winning the group. The USA went on to defeat Mexico on penalties in the second round but then lost to Brazil 1–0 in the semi-finals. They then fell to Colombia 4–1 in the third-place game, finishing fourth overall.
In this edition of the tournament, extra time was never played if a match was drawn after 90 minutes. Instead it went straight to a penalty shootout.
