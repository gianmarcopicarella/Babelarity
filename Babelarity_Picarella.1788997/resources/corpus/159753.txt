Saffig is a municipality in the district of Mayen-Koblenz in Rhineland-Palatinate, western Germany.
The organ pipes and the ear show St. Cäcilia, the patron saint of the Catholic church of Saffig. The lava dome shows the territory of vulcanos, where Saffig is.
The village was first referenced in 1258 as "Saffge". Saffig was a fiefdom of Cologne until 1481, when it became a fiefdom of the family von der Leyen. After the annexation of sinistral territory of the Rhine during the French Revolutionary Wars (1794–1815), Saffig was a "Mairie" of France. Saffig has been part of the Pellenz "Verbandsgemeinde" since 1992.
