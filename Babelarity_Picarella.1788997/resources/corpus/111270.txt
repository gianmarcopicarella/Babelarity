Urraca of Castile (1186/28 May 1187 – 3 November 1220) was a daughter of Alfonso VIII of Castile and Eleanor of England. Her maternal grandparents were Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine.
Urraca was originally considered as a prospective bride for Louis VIII of France, but Eleanor objected to her name (Urraca means magpie in Castilian), preferring the Castilian name of Urraca's sister Blanche, Blanca.
In 1206 Urraca married twenty-one-year-old Afonso II of Portugal, who was the "infante", the intended heir to the throne.
In 1212 her husband became king and she became queen. Afonso II indicated in his will in 1214 that Urraca should be the regent for his heir should he pre-decease her. Unfortunately, she died before him at a relatively young age in 1220. Urraca was buried at the Alcobaça Monastery.
