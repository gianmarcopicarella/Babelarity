Marshall's previous name, changed in 1984, from Fortuna Ledge, was a mining village in the 1800s and early 1900s, with mining operations in Wilson Creek, just down river from the Ledge. With that, many Alaska natives were moved from other villages, as far away as Unalakleet, Ohogamuit and Takchak. With that, there are two main native groups, the Yupik descendants, hailing from both Takchak and Ohogamuit, and the Inupiaq descendants, hailing from Unalakleet. Along with the Native descent, Marshall does boast a hefty proportion of Russian descendants mixed in with the Inupiaqs, and have since mingled with the Yupik ancestry, and has become a Yupik/Inupiaq/Russian community.
