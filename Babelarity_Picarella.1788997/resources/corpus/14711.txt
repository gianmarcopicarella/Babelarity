Duilio César Jean Pierre Davino Rodríguez (born 21 March 1976 in León, Guanajuato) is a retired Mexican footballer
Davino was called up to play in the 1995 Pan American games and played for Mexico in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. He made his professional debut for the Tecos UAG in 1994. Two years later, he played for the national team's senior side in the CONCACAF Gold Cup. In 1997, he moved to Club America. Davino's success at the club level helped him reach the 1998 World Cup in France, where he played under Manuel Lapuente, who later became his coach at América. He is the son of the former Argentine footballer Jorge Davino, and the brother of Flavio Davino, a fellow defenseman who played for Tecos UAG and retired from soccer in 2006. Dulio also had another brother Jorge Davino, who died in a car accident and it is said that Jorge had more potential than his two brothers.
Davino chose not to continue at FC Dallas and left at the end of the 2008 season terminating his 2-year contract. He played as a defensive player for CF Monterrey until May 2011 when he announced his departure from the club to Estudiantes Tecos.
