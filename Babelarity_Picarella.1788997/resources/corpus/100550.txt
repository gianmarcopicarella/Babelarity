Erki Nool (born 25 June 1970 in Võru, Estonia) is an Estonian decathlete and politician.
Nool is a winner of the gold medal for decathlon in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. Although Nool did not place first in any individual event, his total score was the highest. Nool won the title after the competition referee decided to over-rule a discus judge, who had red-flagged his last and only valid attempt due to alleged step-out. The reinstatement of his 43.66-metre third throw sparked unsuccessful counter-protests from other teams. Nool took gold ahead of the Czech Roman Šebrle and American Chris Huffins.
On September 1997 he established the first private athletics school in Estonia.
Since 2005, Erki Nool has been the Vice Chairman of the EOC Athletes Commission and since 2007, member of the European Athletics Development Committee.
In 2006, Nool participated as a celebrity contestant on the first season of Tantsud tähtedega, an Estonian version of Dancing with the Stars. His professional dancing partner was Ave Vardja.
Nool was elected to the Estonian Parliament, Riigikogu, on 4 March 2007, representing the Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica.
Since 2008, he is also member of the Executive Committee of the Estonian Olympic Committee.
