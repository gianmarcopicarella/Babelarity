MARCA is a Spanish national daily sport newspaper owned by Unidad Editorial. The newspaper focuses primarily on football, in particular the day-to-day activities of Real Madrid, Atlético Madrid and Rayo Vallecano. It has a daily readership of over 2,500,000, the highest in Spain for a daily newspaper, and more than half of sports readership.
Since February 2001 there has also been an associated 24-hour/day sports radio station, Radio Marca. In 2010 the TV channel MARCA TV was launched, before being closed in 2013.
MARCA was founded on 21 December 1938, at the height of the Spanish Civil War, in nationalist-held San Sebastián. Its first editor was Manuel Fernández Cuesta. On 3 September 1987 Luis Infante became the editor of the paper.
Punto Editorial SA was the owner of Marca. In 1984 Espacio Editorial, which would be later called Recoletos, acquired the paper. The company merged with Unedisa in 2007 to found Unidad Editorial which is the owner of Marca.
The publisher of the paper is also Unidad Editorial and the sister newspapers are El Mundo and Expansión. MARCA is published in tabloid format.
On 25 November 1942 it ceased being published as a weekly publication and has been published as a daily ever since. The daily was awarded the World’s Best Designed Newspaper™ for 2004 by the Society for News Design (SND).
On 21 December 2007 MARCA hosted a gala event, featuring the leading Spanish sportsmen of the 20th century, to celebrate the newspaper's 70th anniversary.
The paper had been involved in an ongoing dispute with Sir Alex Ferguson since the summer of 2008 when he accused MARCA of being Real Madrid's"... vehicle to unsettle players" . 
In October 2012, MARCA announced launching the Spanish edition of the video games media outlet IGN, effectively replacing their own MARCA Player gaming news website. MARCA also planned to launch another Spanish edition of IGN for Spanish-speakers in Latin America.
In 2001 MARCA had a circulation of 403,000 copies. Its circulation was 382,000 copies in 2003, making it the second best selling newspaper in the country.
