The Men's 69 kg weightlifting event at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom, took place at ExCeL London on 31 July.
Total score was the sum of the lifter's best result in each of the snatch and the clean and jerk, with three lifts allowed for each lift. In case of a tie, the lighter lifter won; if still tied, the lifter who took the fewest attempts to achieve the total score won. Lifters without a valid snatch score did not perform the clean and jerk.
