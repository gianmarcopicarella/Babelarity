Joseph Brunner (November 26, 1706 –– November 19, 1827) was born in Trappstadt and died in Altenstein. Once considered to have been the oldest proven person, information has recently surfaced which suggests he may have only been born in 1739, making him 88 years old at the time of his death [1][2][3]
