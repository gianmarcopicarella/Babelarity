The Jewish Quarter of Třebíč placed in Moravian town Třebíč in the Czech Republic is one of the best preserved Jewish ghettos in Europe. Therefore, it was listed in 2003 (together with the Jewish Cemetery and the St. Procopius Basilica in Třebíč) in the UNESCO World Heritage List and it is the only Jewish monument outside Israel specifically placed on the List.
The Jewish Quarter is situated on the north bank of the River Jihlava, surrounded by rocks and the river. In the Jewish Quarter there are 123 houses, two synagogues and a Jewish cemetery which isn't in the area of the town.
All original Jewish inhabitants (in 1890 there lived nearly 1,500 Jews, but in the 1930s only 300 of them were of Jewish faith) were deported and murdered in concentration camps by Nazis during the World War II. Only ten of them came back after the war. Therefore, many buildings of the Jewish town (e. g. the town hall, rabbi's office, hospital, poorhouse or school) do not serve their original purpose any more and the houses are now owned by people of non-Jewish faith.
