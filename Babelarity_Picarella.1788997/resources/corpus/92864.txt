The Craugastoridae, or fleshbelly frogs, are a family of New World direct-developing frogs. As delineated here, following the Amphibian Species of the World, it is a large family containing 746 species. They are found from the southern United States southwards to Central and South America.
The taxonomy of these frogs is not yet settled, and other sources may treat the subfamily Strabomantinae as a family, Strabomantidae, with correspondingly smaller Craugastoridae. The most recent rearrangement of subfamilies and genera is from 2014.
With the possible exception of Craugastor laticeps that may be ovoviviparous, craugastorid frogs have direct development: no free-living tadpole stage is known; instead, eggs develop directly into small froglets.
The following taxonomy follows Padial and colleagues (2014) and is adopted by the Amphibian Species of the World.

Atopophrynus Lynch and Ruiz-Carranza, 1982 (monotypic).
Geobatrachus Ruthven, 1915 (monotypic)
