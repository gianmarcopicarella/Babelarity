Eiko Hisamura (久村 栄子, Hisamura Eiko, née Yamada (山田), born June 13, 1954 in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan) is a Japanese voice actress and theatre actress. Hisamura worked under her maiden name before her marriage and for a long time afterward, so that name is still often used, even among fans.
