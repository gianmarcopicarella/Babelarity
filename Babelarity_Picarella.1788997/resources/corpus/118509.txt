Epsilon Delphini (ε Del, ε Delphini) is a blue-white giant star approximately 358 light-years away in the constellation Delphinus. It has the traditional name Deneb Dulfim (occasianally Deneb or Al Dhanab al Dulfim), from the Arabic ذنب الدلفين ðanab ad-dulfīn "tail of the dolphin."
The term ðanab ad-dulfīn or Dzaneb al Delphin was appeared in the catalogue of stars in the Calendarium of Al Achsasi Al Mouakket, which was translated into Latin as Cauda Delphini, meaning the dolphin's tail.
In Chinese, 敗瓜 (Bài Guā), meaning Rotten Gourd, refers to an asterism consisting of ε Delphini, η Delphini, θ Delphini, ι Delphini and κ Delphini. Consequently, ε Delphini itself is known as 敗瓜一 (Bài Guā yī, English: the First Star of Rotten Gourd.). From this Chinese name, the name Pae Chaou was appeared 
The star is slightly variable, occasionally brightening to magnitude 3.95.
