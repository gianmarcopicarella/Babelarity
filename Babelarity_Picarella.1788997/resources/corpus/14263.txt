And in their last group game against Honduras Lang played his first tournament game.
On 1 June 2015, Lang joined Basel on a free transfer. He made his first team league debut on 19 July 2015 in the 2–0 home win against Vaduz. He scored his first goal for his new club just one week later on 25 July during the away game against his old club Grasshoppers Club. It was the last goal of the game and Basel won 3–2. Under trainer Urs Fischer Lang won the Swiss Super League championship at the end of the 2015–16 Super League season. For the club it was the seventh titel in a row and their 19th championship titel in total.
