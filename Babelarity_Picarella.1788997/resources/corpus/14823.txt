Cícero João de Cézare (born 24 June 1980), nicknamed Cicinho (Portuguese pronunciation: [siˈsĩɲu]), is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays for Turkish club Sivasspor as a right back.
Born in Pradópolis, São Paulo, Cicinho won the Club World Cup in 2005 while playing for São Paulo. After that, he joined Real Madrid.
In the 2006–07 season, Cicinho suffered an extensive injury to his ACL and missed over six months. His comeback, to not only the pitch, but also the starting lineup, was marked on Sunday, 29 April 2007, against Athletic Bilbao. He assisted Ruud van Nistelrooy's first goal with a cross, and played a part in van Nistelrooy's second goal as well. Real Madrid went on to win the game 4–1.
In the 2007–08 pre-season, the full back received less playing time at Real Madrid under new coach Bernd Schuster. Michel Salgado and Sergio Ramos were used on the right during most of Real's pre-season, and Cicinho therefore requested a transfer to A.S. Roma who had been following him for some time.
On 22 August 2007, Cicinho signed for Roma for a fee up to €11 million. Cicinho signed a five-year contract with the capital club worth from €3.6M in the first year up to €4 million in the last year (in gross salary, i.e. include tax), with additional bonuses.
He made his official debut in a Roma jersey on the first matchday of Serie A against Palermo, as a substitute for Ludovic Giuly in the second half. Roma went on to win the game 2–0.
On 9 February 2010, Cicinho joined São Paulo on loan until on 30 June 2010. This loan came after a 2009–10 season in which Cicinho received less playing time under new manager Claudio Ranieri in favor of Marco Cassetti and Marco Motta.
On 13 January 2011, he returned to Spain; this time joining Villarreal on loan until the end of the season.
In 2011-12 season Cicinho returned to Roma. He was the third choice for right back behind Marco Cassetti and Aleandro Rosi. He played only 2 matches in a 2011-12 season, first against Siena and second against Fiorentina in which he was a starter. His contract expired on 30 June, and he returned to Brazil.
After playing for Villarreal CF and Sport Recife of Brazil, Cicinho, in July 2013, signed with Sivasspor of Turkey, by coach Roberto Carlos, who claimed his signing for club. After one year, Cicinho had become a key player, and, in April 2014, he renewed his contract with club of Sivas for two more years.
He was part of the Brazil national team that won the 2005 Confederations Cup and was one of the 23 players chosen to represent Brazil in the 2006 World Cup.
In addition to being Brazilian, he is also an Italian citizen, having a grandfather from Tione degli Abruzzi in Abruzzo whose last name was "De Cesare", then poorly transcribed as De Cézare by the registry office.
