The 1986–87 season was the 32nd season of the European Cup, Europe's premier club football competition. The tournament was won by Porto, who came from behind in the final against Bayern Munich to give Portugal its first title since 1962.
Steaua București, the defending champions, were eliminated by Anderlecht in the second round, having received a bye to reach that stage of the tournament due to the absence of the English champions (Liverpool), as the ban on English clubs in European competitions was now in its second season.
