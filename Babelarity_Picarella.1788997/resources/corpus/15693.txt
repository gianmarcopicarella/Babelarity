The Men's 5000 metres competition at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom. The event was held at the Olympic Stadium on 8â€“11 August.
The final race started out slowly, the first lap in 74.1 and that only accelerated because Hayle Ibrahimov accelerated the last 100. The field continued running splits in the 70's, Lopez Lomong leading through 2000 in a pedestrian 5:56.7. In the seventh lap Yenew Alamirew moved to the front and accelerated the pace, the next several laps down below 62, Mo Farah the only one to break up the Ethiopian team at the front. With 700 to go, Farah took the lead, his training partner Galen Rupp joining him with 500 to go, as the rest of the field jostling to be in position to sprint. First Hagos Gebrhiwet challenged, then disappeared. Down the backstretch, Thomas Pkemei Longosiwa challenged, with Abdalaati Iguider immediately behind. Dejen Gebremeskel, Bernard Lagat and Isiah Kiplangat Koech packing up around the final turn. At the head of the stretch, Koech contacted Lagat as he was just coming clear to sprint, Lagat stumbling. Meanwhile Farah was accelerating ahead of Longosiwa, who couldn't handle the speed. Gebremeskel went around the outside with Lagat's delayed sprint unable to catch Longosiwa. The winning time was more than 15 seconds slower than the slowest time in qualifying.
