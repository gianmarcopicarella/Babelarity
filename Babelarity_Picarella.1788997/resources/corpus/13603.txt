Atlético Clube de Portugal is a Portuguese sports club from the Alcântara parish in Lisbon, founded on 18 September 1942. The club was formed with the union of two clubs; Carcavelinhos Football Clube and União Foot-Ball Lisbon. Although Atlético successfully competes in sports such as futsal and basketball, it is most known for its football team.
The football team of Atlético has played 24 seasons in the national first division, the last season being 1976–77. The club has won the Portuguese Second Division in 1944–45, 1958–59 and 1967–68 and the Portuguese Third Division in 2003–04 and 2005–06. They currently play in the Campeonato de Portugal after being relegated in the 2015–16 season. Atlético Clube de Portugal are currently sponsored by Spanish sports brand Joma.
The basketball team of the club won the Cup of Portugal in 1944 and 1954 and was runners-up in 1982.
Atlético Clube de Portugal was formed with the merger of Carcavelinhos Football Clube and União Football Lisboa. The latter club was established on 3 March 1910 by a group of people from Santo Amaro. The team was initially called Grupo dos 15 ("Group of 15") due to fifteen people establishing the club. Since then the club has been successful in several different sports including association football, basketball, futsal, swimming, cycling, hockey and rugby.
Carcavelinhos was established in 1912. In 1928, they won the Campeonato de Portugal, followed by the Portuguese Second Division in 1935 and 1939. Under the name of União de Lisboa, the club managed to reach the final of the Campeonato de Portugal in 1929 where they lost to Belenenses 3–1 at the Campo de Palhavã.
Arguably the most successful period of Atlético Clube de Portugal came just a few years after its establishment. The club reached two Taça de Portugal finals in the 1940s. Their first final in 1946 saw them play Sporting CP at the Estádio Nacional in Oeiras, where they lost 4–2. The second final came three years later, and this time they played Benfica only to lose again 2–1.
Since the club's establishment they have played at the Estádio da Tapadinha. The stadium has a capacity of 10,000. It has hosted international matches, primarily Portugal U21 games, in the past. Since the club has returned to the Segunda Liga for the 2011–12 season, the club has improved its financial status due to finishing in a credible eleventh place. Due to this the club has announced the renovation of the stadium which would improve all the facilities as well as its stands and would be ready for the start of the 2012–13 Segunda Liga.
