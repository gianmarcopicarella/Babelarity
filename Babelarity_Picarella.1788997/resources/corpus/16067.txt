Jeonnam Dragons (전남 드래곤즈) is a football club founded in 1994 in the Korean city of Gwangyang, Jeonnam province which joined the K League Classic for the 1995 season at the same time as Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors, their Jeolla province rivals. Before January 6, 2014, their name was spelled as Chunnam Dragons.
Jeonnam was established on 16 December 1994. Chunnam appointed Jung Byung-Tak, former South Korean international left winger, as their first manager.
25 March 1995, Jeonnam played their first ever K-League match. Chunnam's best season to date came in 1997 when they finished runners-up, behind Daewoo Royals in the K-League and also lifted the Korean FA Cup. In 1999, Jeonnam also came runners-up in the Asian Cup Winners Cup, beating J-League giant Kashima Antlers 4–1. They became Korean FA Cup champions for a second straight year in 2007.
On 27 December 2007, Jeonnam appointed Park Hang-Seo as new manager after former manager Huh Jung-Moo was appointed as Korea Republic national football team manager.
Curiously the team`s classic rival Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors was established the same year.
