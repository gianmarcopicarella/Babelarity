Pentaerythritol is an organic compound with the formula C5H12O4. This white, crystalline polyol with the neopentane backbone is a versatile building block for the preparation of many polyfunctionalized compounds such as the explosive pentaerythritol tetranitrate and pentaerythritol tetraacrylate. Derivatives of pentaerythritol are components of alkyd resins, varnishes, polyvinyl chloride stabilizers, tall oil esters, and olefin antioxidants.
Halogen-free pentaerythritol esters are also environmentally friendly alternative to conventional electrical transformer fluids, being both readily biodegradable and non-hazardous in water. They advantageously replace polychlorobiphenyl (PCB), and even silicone-based or fluorinated hydrocarbons, as dielectric fluid in transformers. Their low volatility and high flash point give them an excellent resistance to ignition in case of major electrical failure and transformer rupture.
Pentaerythritol also finds use in pyrotechnics, as it is needed to make 'blue aluminium'.
Pentaerythritol was first synthesized in 1891 by German chemists Bernhard Tollens and his student P. Wigand.
