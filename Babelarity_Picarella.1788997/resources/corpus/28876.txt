The Bell 412 is a twin-engine utility helicopter manufactured by Bell Helicopter. It is a development of the Bell 212 with the major difference being the composite four-blade main rotor.
Development began in the late 1970s with two Bell 212s being converted into 412 prototypes. An advanced four blade main rotor with a smaller diameter replaced the 212's two blade rotor. A Bell 412 prototype first flew in August 1979. The initial model was certified in January 1981 with the deliveries commencing in the same month.
The 412 model was followed by the 412SP (Special Performance) version featuring larger fuel capacity, higher takeoff weight and optional seating arrangements. In 1991, the 412HP (High Performance) variant with improved transmission replaced the SP version in production. The current production version, 412EP (Enhanced Performance), is equipped with a dual digital automatic flight control system. In 2013 Bell introduced the 412EPI which includes an electronic engine control (FADEC) for a PT6T-9 engine upgrade, and a glass cockpit display system similar to the Bell model 429. Also featured is a Garmin touch-screen navigation system, and the BLR Strake and Fast Fin upgrades for improved hover performance.
Over 700 Model 412s (including 260 by AgustaWestland) have been built.
