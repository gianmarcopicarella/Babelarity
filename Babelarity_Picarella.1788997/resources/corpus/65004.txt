In mathematics, a lituus is a spiral with polar equation
          r
            2
        θ
        =
        k
    {\displaystyle r^{2}\theta =k\,}
where k is any non-zero constant. Thus, the angle θ is inversely proportional to the square of the radius r.
This spiral, which has two branches depending on the sign of 
        r
    {\displaystyle r}
  , is asymptotic to the 
        x
    {\displaystyle x}
   axis. Its points of inflexion are at 
        (
        θ
        ,
        r
        )
        =
        (
              1
              2
        ,
            2
            k
        )
    {\displaystyle (\theta ,r)=({\tfrac {1}{2}},{\sqrt {2k}})}
   and 
        (
              1
              2
        ,
        −
            2
            k
        )
    {\displaystyle ({\tfrac {1}{2}},-{\sqrt {2k}})}
  .
The curve was named for the ancient Roman lituus by Roger Cotes in a collection of papers entitled Harmonia Mensurarum (1722), which was published six years after his death.
