Australasia was the name of a combined team of athletes from Australia and New Zealand that competed together at the 1908 and 1912 Summer Olympics. When the Olympic Games resumed in 1920 after World War I, the two nations sent separate teams to the Games.
The Australasia team won a total of twelve medals in the two Olympiads in which they competed, mostly in swimming. One New Zealander won a medal in 1908 (Harry Kerr a bronze in athletics), and two New Zealanders (Malcolm Champion a gold in swimming, Tony Wilding a bronze in tennis) won medals in 1912; all other medalists for Australasia were Australians.
