The golden-winged parakeet (Brotogeris chrysoptera) is a species of bird in the Psittacidae family, the true parrots.
It is found in Brazil, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, (the Guianas), and Venezuela in the eastern Amazon Basin and the lower Orinoco River region of eastern Venezuela. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and heavily degraded former forest.
The golden-winged parakeet can be found mostly in the eastern Amazon Basin, and upstream on the Amazon River to eastern Amazonas state Brazil; to the southwest, 1700 km upstream on the Madeira River to the border of Bolivia.
In the northeast Basin, the range is contiguous into the Guianas, the Guiana Shield and westward into eastern Venezuela. In Roraima state Brazil bordering eastern Venezuela, all but the northwest is in the range; the range continues south to the Amazon River down Roraima's Branco River, and then continues west upriver on the Rio Negro as the furthest west range extension.
For the southeast quadrant of the Amazon Basin, only the lower half of the tributary rivers are in the bird's range, in Amazonas, Pará, and Maranhão states. Very northern Tocantins state is included at the Araguaia-Tocantins River confluence. Amapá state in the northeast bordering French Guiana is the last Brazilian state with the parakeet's range; it is also on Marajó Island, Ilha de Marajo. The two other rivers in the center of the south range are the north flowing Tapajós and Xingu River systems.
The golden-winged parakeet is also found in northeastern Venezuela in the downstream regions surrounding the Orinoco River; the contiguous range continues eastward into Guyuna and the Guiana Shield highlands and southeastwards into Roraima.
