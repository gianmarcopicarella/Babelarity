On 25 June 1836, at 22:15, residents awoke to a man yelling "Fire! Fire!". In almost 2 hours, almost half of the eastern part of the town was burnt down, including the parish church, the two schools, City Hall, 55 houses, and 16 outbuildings. 127 families were rendered homeless. Three years later, on 18 June 1839 midnight, another fire broke out in the market. Within two hours, 29 houses and 17 outbuildings in the south side of town were the victims of the fire.
