Cycling at the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics was held from August 17 to August 24. The events took place at the Nanjing Olympic Sports Center and Laoshan National Forest Park in Nanjing, China.
For the Youth Olympics instead of competitors competing separately they compete as a team. In the boys' and girls' team event two athletes compete together. Each of the two riders must compete in two of the following events, with only one team member competing per event; BMX, Mountain Bike Cross-country Race, Mountain Bike Cross-country Eliminator and Road Time Trial. Both members will also have to compete in the Road Race event. 
For the mixed team relay two boys and two girls will form a team. The event will be composed of a Mountain Bike Cross-country Race, performed by one boy and one girl and a Road Race, performed by the other two team members. For NOCs who qualified only two men or women lots will be drawn to form combined teams. 
Each National Olympic Committee (NOC) can enter a maximum of 2 teams of 2 athletes, 1 per each gender. As hosts, China was given the maximum quota, but only elected to send a female team and a further 6 teams, 3 in each gender was initially given to the Tripartite Commission, but only three spots were given. The other spots were reallocated. The remaining 28 teams shall be decided by rankings from the 2013 Junior Mountain Bike World Championships, 2013 Junior BMX World Championships, 2013 Women’s Junior Road World Championships and 2013 Men’s Junior Road Nations Cup (events between 1 April 2013 and 31 March 2014 are considered).
