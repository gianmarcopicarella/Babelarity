Cheste (Valencian: Xest) is a municipality in the comarca of Hoya de Buñol in the Valencian Community, Spain, located 26 km from the capital Valencia.
According to the Valencian historian Escolano, the first settlers of the region of Cheste were members of Iberian tribes belonging to the old Edetania. This view is supported by numerous remains, particularly those of El Castillarejo (Iberian ceramics and spear points from the Bronze Age).
The "Treasure of Cheste", a set of jewels and gold and silver coins, was found in the locality of "la Safa" in 1864. Among the coins there was a denarius Sgdenham 140 (RRC 44,5 from 211 BC) which enabled the find to be dated to the second Punic war.
About five kilometers to the east of the town is the "Circuit de Valencia", a motor sport race track which hosts the Valencian Community motorcycle Grand Prix since 1999.
