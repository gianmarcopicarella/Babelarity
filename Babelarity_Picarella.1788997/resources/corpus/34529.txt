Chromosome 4 is one of the 23 pairs of chromosomes in humans. People normally have two copies of this chromosome. Chromosome 4 spans more than 186 million base pairs (the building material of DNA) and represents between 6 and 6.5 percent of the total DNA in cells.
The chromosome is ~191 megabases in length. Seven hundred and fifty seven protein encoding genes have been identified on this chromosome to date. Two-hundred and eleven (27.9%) of these coding sequences currently do not have any experimental evidence at the protein level. two-hundred and seventy one appear to be membrane proteins. 54 have been classified as cancer associated proteins.
