Waitakere United is a football club based in Waitakere City, New Zealand. They are one of the franchises in the ASB Premiership. They play their home games at Fred Taylor Park in Kumeu.
Waitakere United was formed as a special franchise club in 2004 to play in the New Zealand Football Championship (NZFC), New Zealand's top domestic football competition. The team represents 12 member clubs from Mt Albert to the Kaipara.
In the inaugural season (2004–05) of the NZFC, Waitakere United finished runners-up to champions Auckland City but they followed up with a very disappointing 6th place in the next season. In the following season, however, Waitakere finished as NZFC premiers but lost in the grand final once again to Auckland City FC 3–2.
Due to the withdrawal of Vanuatu's Port Vila Sharks, Waitakere was given a berth in the inaugural OFC Champions League, for 2007, as NZFC premiers. They finished atop their group, edging out Auckland City and New Caledonia's AS Mont-Dore. They went on to defeat Ba FC of Fiji in the final, becoming the first OFC-League champions. Commins Menapi scored a crucial away goal that proved the difference as the tie finished 2–2 in aggregate. Taking this championship qualified United to compete in the 2007 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where they lost in the 'play-in' match to Sepahan 1–3.
Waitakere United defended their championship in capturing the 2007–08 OFC Champions League, defeating Kossa in the final 6–3 in goal aggregate. During this season, Douglas Field was under extensive renovation forcing Waitakere United to play most of their home fixtures at Fred Taylor Park in Whenuapai.
Waitakere have a notable rivalry with neighbours Auckland City.
