Hockey is an American indie rock band from Portland, Oregon.
Until October 2010, the band consisted of singer Benjamin Grubin, guitarist Brian Stuart White, bassist Jeremy Reynolds, drummer Anthony Stassi and touring keyboardist Ryan Dolliver, and have been compared in their sound to bands such as The Strokes and LCD Soundsystem. In October 2010 the band announced that Brian White and Anthony Stassi "have left the group to pursue other interests/horizons", as published on their Facebook page.
The band released a home-made EP Mind Chaos in 2008, and they are now signed to Capitol Records in the US and Virgin Records in the UK.
Hockey played on the stage of John Peel at Glastonbury 2009. In July 2009 they played on the Red Bull Bedrooms Jam Futures Stage at the T in the Park festival in Scotland. They have also made appearances at the 2009 Bonnaroo Festival, and the main stage of the 2009 Hove Festival in Norway on 23 June. The band's debut single "Too Fake" was released in the UK on March 16. The band released "Learn To Lose" on June 1 ahead of their debut album Mind Chaos, which was released in the US on September 14 and in the UK on September 28.
In late 2009, the band was chosen as one of Beyond Race Magazine's "50 Emerging Artists," resulting in a spot in the publication's #11 issue, as well as a Q&A for the magazine's site.
In January 2012 the band announced that they had started recording their upcoming album, and hoped to have it finished by summer.
