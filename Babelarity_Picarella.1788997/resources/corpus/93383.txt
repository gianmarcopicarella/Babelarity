The Eleutherodactylidae are a family of direct-developing frogs native to northern South America, the Caribbean, and southernmost North America. They are sometimes known under common name rain frogs. Formerly a subfamily Eleutherodactylinae of the Leptodactylidae family, it was raised to the family status following a major revision of New World direct-developing frogs in 2008. As currently defined, the family has more than 200 species (as of 2014, 206 or 207 species).
Eleutherodactylid frogs vary considerably in size, from the minuscule Eleutherodactylus iberia (female snout–vent length 10.5 mm (0.41 in)) to the relative giant Eleutherodactylus inoptatus (female snout–vent length 88 mm (3.5 in)). Except for the ovoviviparous Eleutherodactylus jasperi, these frogs have direct development: no free-living tadpole stage exists; instead, eggs develop directly into small froglets.
The two subfamilies and four genera are:
Eleutherodactylinae Lutz, 1954 (197 species)
Diasporus Hedges, Duellman, and Heinicke, 2008
Eleutherodactylus Duméril and Bibron, 1841
Phyzelaphryninae Hedges, Duellman, and Heinicke, 2008 (9 species)
Adelophryne Hoogmoed and Lescure, 1984
Phyzelaphryne Heyer, 1977
