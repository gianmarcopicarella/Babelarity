Tokyo University of the Arts (東京藝術大学, Tōkyō Geijutsu Daigaku) or Geidai (芸大) is an art school in Japan. Located in Ueno Park, it also has facilities in Toride, Ibaraki, Yokohama, Kanagawa, and Kitasenju, Adachi, Tokyo. The university owns two halls of residence: one (for both Japanese and international students) in Adachi, Tokyo, and the other (for mainly international students) in Matsudo, Chiba.
The university was formed in 1949 by the merger of the Tokyo School of Fine Arts (東京美術学校, Tōkyō Bijutsu Gakkō) and the Tokyo Music School (東京音楽学校, Tōkyō Ongaku Gakkō), both of which were founded in 1887. Originally male-only, the schools began to admit women in 1946. The graduate school opened in 1963, and began offering doctoral degrees in 1977. After the National University Corporations were formed on April 1, 2004, the school became known as the Kokuritsu Daigaku Hōjin Tōkyō Geijutsu Daigaku ((国立大学法人東京藝術大学). On April 1, 2008, the university changed its English name from "Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music" to "Tokyo University of the Arts."
The school has had student exchanges with a number of other art and music institutions such as the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (USA), the Royal Academy of Music (UK), the University of Sydney and Queensland College of Art, Griffith University (Australia), the Korea National University of Arts, and the China Central Academy of Fine Arts.
