On December 5, 2012 during a show at the Majestic Theater in Madison, Wisconsin, before Lzzy could start her piano ballad "Break In", guitarist Joe Hottinger ran up to her from off stage and told her that the song "Love Bites...(So Do I)" was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Category. Drummer Arejay Hale asked on his mic what happened and after Lzzy replied to the audience that they had just been nominated for a Grammy, the crowd erupted in celebration. The entire event was recorded by a fan and posted on YouTube. On February 10, 2013 Halestorm won the award, becoming the first female-fronted band to both be nominated and win in that category. In April 2013, Halestorm reached the top of the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for the first time with their single "Freak Like Me".

Halestorm covered the Dio song "Straight Through the Heart" on the tribute album Ronnie James Dio - This Is Your Life, which was released on March 25, 2014. This gave the band the opportunity to work with Rick Marty again, who was one of the musical coordinators for the project. On March 28, 2014 Halestorm performed a brand new song called The Heartbreaker at the Cannery Ballroom in Nashville, Tennessee. In April, the band released a video on YouTube called A Day In The Life Of Halestorm 2014 (Backstage, Interview & New Song Mayhem). The title of the new album was originally set to be released January 13, 2015, but was actually moved a day earlier to January 12. The band has posted letters of the album name allowing for fans to try and unscramble them, and on January 12, 2015, their third full studio album titled "Into the Wild Life" was announced with release dates for the UK and US, April 13 and 14 respectively. In May, 2015 will be released the photo book 'To Hale And Back' in collaboration with photographer Rob Fenn, which documents the career of Halestorm so far.
