Hayden Ernest Stoeckel (born 10 August 1984) is an Olympic and national record-holding backstroke swimmer from Australia. He swam for Australia at the 2008 Olympics where he tied with Russia's Arkady Vyatchanin for the bronze medal in the 100m backstroke; in semifinals of the event he also set a new Australian and Commonwealth Record (52.97).

Stoeckel started his swimming with the Berri Swimming Club in South Australia. The swimming pool in Berri was renamed the "Hayden Stoeckel Swimming Pool" after he won two medals at the 2008 Olympics.
At the 2007 World Championships, Stoeckel failed to advance from the preliminary heats of the 50-metre backstroke after coming 21st in a time of 26.38, failing to progress by 0.14 of a second. In the 100-metre event, he missed out on the semifinals by 0.01, placing 17th in the heats in a time of 55.64 seconds. However, one of the swimmers ahead of him withdrew from the semifinals, so he swam, finishing last in 55.51.
