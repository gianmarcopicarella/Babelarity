The Kildin-class destroyer was a series of destroyers built for the Soviet Navy in the late 1950s. They were a missile armed version of the Kotlin-class destroyer, and the class was named for Kildin Island. Four ships were built around the KSShch (КСЩ, SS-N-1) anti-ship missile. When this missile became obsolete in the 1960s, three ships were modernised in 1972-1977. All ships were decommissioned in the late 1980s early 1990s. The Soviet designation was Project 56EM for the prototype (Bedovyy), Project 56M for three series ships, and Project 56U for the modernised ships.
The Kotlin-class hull and machinery were retained, A rail SSM launcher was fitted at the stern and the forward 130mm gun was replaced by two quad 57mm anti aircraft guns (45mm in Bedovyy). The torpedo tubes were replaced by twin 533mm tubes located on the beam. After the SSN-1 missile was declared to be obsolete the Soviets replaced these missiles with two 76mm gun turrets aft and four SSN-2 missile launchers.
