The cattle tyrant (Machetornis rixosa) is a species of bird in the family Tyrannidae. It is the only member of the genus Machetornis.
It is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela.
Its natural habitats are pastureland and heavily degraded former forest. Due to deforestation, the species has recently colonized areas where it was previously absent, such as northeast Ecuador.
Cattle tyrants feed on parasitic arthropods on mammals, an example of a cleaning symbiosis.
