Phillip Anthony "Phil" Bardsley (born 28 June 1985) is a footballer who plays for Stoke City and the Scotland national team. Although born in England, Bardsley qualifies for Scotland through his Glasgow-born father.
Bardsley began his career with Manchester United where he made 18 appearances in five seasons at the club. During that time, he was loaned to several clubs, including Royal Antwerp, Burnley, Rangers, Aston Villa and Sheffield United.
He joined Sunderland in January 2008 for an initial fee of £850,000. Bardsley established himself as a regular at the Stadium of Light under Steve Bruce and Martin O'Neill and he won the player of the year award in 2010–11. He lost his place in the team in 2012–13 after a falling-out with manager Paolo Di Canio, before returning to the first team under Gus Poyet. Under Poyet, Bardsley helped Sunderland to avoid relegation in 2013–14 and reach the 2014 Football League Cup Final, in which they lost 3–1 to Manchester City.
After his Sunderland contract expired in June 2014, Bardsley joined Stoke City on a free transfer.
Bardsley attended Hope High School in his hometown, Salford, along with former United team-mates Mark Redshaw and Mark Howard. Bardsley started his career with Charlestown Lads Club also with Redshaw before signing for Manchester United. He grew up near Manchester United's old training ground, The Cliff, and would often go there on his school holidays to see the players train. Prior to his departure for Sunderland, he was the only current player who progressed through all the levels of the academy, starting out at the club at the age of 8.
After coming through the club's youth system, Bardsley was a regular in Manchester United's under-17 team from the 2000–01 season, before progressing to the under-19s from 2002–03. He continued in the under-19s in 2003–04, but appeared more frequently in the reserves before making his first-team debut in a 2–0 defeat to West Bromwich Albion on 3 December 2003 in the fourth round of the League Cup. He made a second appearance for the first team in the 3–0 FA Cup fourth round win over Northampton Town on 25 January 2004, before going on a four-month loan to Manchester United's Belgian feeder club, Royal Antwerp, on 30 January. He made six appearances for Royal Antwerp, including a 4–0 defeat to Club Brugge on 8 February 2004, in which he was sent off for two bookable offences.
After returning to Manchester United at the end of 2003–04, Bardsley made three appearances on the club's 2004–05 pre-season tour of the United States, playing against Bayern Munich, Celtic and Milan. He made another promising start to the 2005–06 season, and an injury to Gary Neville gave him plenty of opportunities to play between August and November 2005. He was regularly named as a substitute for much of the rest of the season, before going on loan to Championship club Burnley on 16 March 2006. He played six games and scored an own goal in the first minute of a 1–1 draw at home to Southampton.
Bardsley again made a significant contribution to Manchester United's pre-season programme in 2006–07, but on 16 August, he was sent out on loan again, this time to Scottish Premier League club Rangers. On 9 September 2006, he scored his only goal for Rangers against Falkirk with a terrific long-range free kick. He was sent off against Hibernian, and therefore missed the Old Firm match against Celtic. On 17 October, it was reported that Bardsley was involved in a training ground disagreement with manager Paul Le Guen and his future at Rangers appeared to be in doubt. Indeed, Bardsley never played for Rangers again and returned to Manchester United in December.
On 8 January 2007, Bardsley joined Aston Villa on loan until the end of the season and played his first Premiership game against Watford on 20 January. It was announced on 1 May that Bardsley would be returning to Manchester United when his loan deal with Villa ran out as manager Martin O'Neill did not want to make the move permanent.
After playing what would turn out to be his last match for the Manchester United first team against Coventry City in the League Cup on 26 September 2007, it was confirmed on 15 October Bardsley would join Sheffield United on loan until January 2008. He made his full debut for the Blades a few days later in a 1–1 draw with Preston North End at Bramall Lane. Despite Sheffield United agreeing a deal with Manchester United to sign him permanently, Bardsley left at the end of his loan deal in January 2008 after playing 16 games.
On 22 January 2008, Bardsley joined Sunderland on a three-and-a-half-year contract in a deal worth an initial £850,000, potentially rising to £2 million. He made his debut in a 2–0 win against Birmingham City in the Premier League on 29 January. Bardsley played 11 times under Roy Keane in 2007–08 as Sunderland successfully avoided relegation by three points. On 27 August 2008 Bardsley scored his first goal in English football in a 2–1 victory against Nottingham Forest in the League Cup. Bardsley lost out to Pascal Chimbonda during the first half of the 2008–09 campaign before regaining his place in the team in November 2008. He retained his place under Ricky Sbragia, playing in total 33 times in 2008–09 as Sunderland survived relegation on the final day of the season.
Bardsley kept his place under new manager Steve Bruce for the first half of the 2009–10 season until loan signing Alan Hutton took his place in February 2010. From there until the end of the campaign Bardsley was mainly used as a substitute and due his lack of playing time, Bardsley stated that he may have to consider leaving. However Hutton didn't make his move permanent and Bardsley was able to reclaim his place in the side and in November 2010, he signed a new three-and-a-half-year deal running until summer 2014. He scored his first league goal against Aston Villa on 5 January 2011 with a 25-yard strike in a 1–0 win. He then scored his second of the season with another long range strike against Chelsea on 1 February 2012 in a 4–2 defeat. He scored another long-range goal on 9 April 2011 in a 3–2 defeat against West Bromwich Albion. In total Bardsley played 37 times in 2010–11 as the Black Cats finished in 10th position. Bardsley's consistent performances during the campaign earned him the Player of the year award.
Bardsley made a poor start to the 2011–12 season as he was sent-off in a 1–0 defeat against rivals Newcastle United on 21 August 2011. He was then handed a retrospective four-match ban by the FA for an altercation Juan Mata in a 2–1 defeat by Chelsea on 10 September 2011. Despite this Bardsley retained his place in the side under Martin O'Neill, playing a total of 37 matches as Sunderland finished in 13th position. He missed the start of the 2012–13 campaign after undergoing ankle surgery in August 2012. Bardsley returned to the side at the end of October 2012, with the team struggling near the bottom of the table. Paolo Di Canio replaced O'Neill in March 2013 and he guided the team to back to back victories over Newcastle United and Everton lifting the club away from the relegation zone. Bardsley scored in the penultimate game of the season in a 1–1 draw with Southampton on 12 May 2013. Bardsley missed the final match of the season away at Tottenham Hotspur after he and Matt Kilgallon were pictured visiting a casino, angering Di Canio who vowed never to play the pair again. Di Canio also fined Bardsley as well as six other Sunderland players for "indiscipline" which prompted an investigation by the PFA.
Bardsley began the 2013–14 season playing with the under-21s and whilst playing against Bolton Wanderers on 12 August 2013 he broke his foot ending Di Canio's attempts to sell him. On 20 August 2013, Bardsley was suspended by Sunderland after mocking the club's opening day defeat to Fulham on a social media site. His suspension was lifted on 4 September 2013 after he apologised. Di Canio was sacked and replaced by Gus Poyet in October 2013 and brought Bardsley back into the first-team. He made a poor start on his return, scoring an own goal in a 4–0 defeat away at Swansea City. His form improved thereafter scoring against Southampton in the League Cup and the only goal in a 1–0 win over Manchester City on 10 November 2013. He scored against his former club Manchester United in the 2nd leg of the League Cup semi-final as Sunderland progressed to the final on penalties. Bardsley played the full match of the 2014 Football League Cup Final as Sunderland lost 3–1 to Manchester City. Bardsley played a total of 33 times in 2013–14 as Sunderland finished in 14th position.
With Bardsley's Sunderland contract due to expire at the end of June 2014, other clubs were free to approach him from January 2014. On 22 May 2014, Bardsley signed a three-year contract with Stoke City. He made his Premier League debut for Stoke on the opening day of the 2014–15 season in a 1–0 defeat against Aston Villa. Bardsley established himself as a regular under Mark Hughes but struggled with discipline, picking up nine yellow cards by March 2015. Bardsley played 30 times for Stoke in the 2014–15 season as Stoke finished in 9th position.
Bardsley lost his place in the Stoke squad for the 2015–16 season following the arrival of Glen Johnson from Liverpool. Despite missing out on league appearances Bardsley played a part in Stoke's League Cup campaign. He was sent-off in the fourth round against Chelsea and scored a 30-yard free kick in the quarter final victory over Sheffield Wednesday. Following injury to Johnson in February, Bardsley took his place back in the side until the end of the season. He made 17 appearances for Stoke in 2015–16 as Stoke again finished in 9th position.
On 6 October 2010, Bardsley received a call-up for the Scotland national team for the Euro 2012 qualifier against the Czech Republic on 8 October 2010. He qualifies because his father was born in Glasgow. He made his debut on 11 October 2010 in a 3–2 defeat by World and European champions Spain, filling in for the injured Alan Hutton.
Bardsley plays at right back and describes himself as a modern full-back.— "Since I started playing professionally, the game has changed and you have to be really, really fit because a full-back is expected to get up and down the pitch. I like to defend and be aggressive, but also get forward to create chances and create goals, it's all part of being a modern-day full-back."
Bardsley married glamour model Tanya Robinson in 2014, with whom he has three children.
