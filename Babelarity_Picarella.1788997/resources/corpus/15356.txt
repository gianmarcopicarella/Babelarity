Marco Stefano Belinelli (Italian pronunciation: [ˈmarko beliˈnɛlli]; born March 25, 1986) is an Italian professional basketball player for the Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was selected 18th overall in the 2007 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors and became the first player born in Italy to win an NBA championship when he won one as a member of the San Antonio Spurs in 2014.
Belinelli played in the Italian Serie A and the Euroleague for Virtus Bologna and Fortitudo Bologna. In 2005, aged nineteen, he won the Serie A title with Fortitudo.
After being selected #18 in the first round of the 2007 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors, Belinelli scored 37 points in his first NBA Summer League game against the New Orleans Hornets, going 14-on-20 from the field, including 5-on-7 from behind the arc, adding 5 boards, 2 assists and 1 steal to help the Warriors earn a 110–102 win. His performance is tied for second for the highest scoring game ever in Vegas summer league history, behind Keith Bogans' 38 scored as a member of the Orlando Magic in 2004. Belinelli finished his Summer League scoring an average of 22.8 points per game in 4 games with the Warriors, before returning to Italy to be part of the Italian national team for EuroBasket 2007. On December 19, 2008, he scored 27 points, in a game the Warriors lost to Atlanta Hawks.

On August 11, 2010, he was traded to the New Orleans Hornets for Julian Wright.
After 2010–11 season, he became a restricted free agent. On December 13, 2011, he signed the $3.4 million qualifying offer to stay with the Hornets for one more year.
On July 24, 2012, Belinelli signed with the Chicago Bulls. Since joining the Bulls, Belinelli developed a reputation of being a clutch player, hitting shots that include a game winning shot against the Celtics in overtime while falling down, a go-ahead layup against the Detroit Pistons after Joakim Noah saved the ball from going out of bounds, a game-winning lay-up with 20 seconds remaining against the Brooklyn Nets, and a 3 pointer to give the Bulls a 1-point lead with 5 seconds remaining in a game vs. the Utah Jazz. Belinelli and Joakim Noah each scored 24 points in a game 7 victory over the Brooklyn Nets in the first round of the 2013 NBA Playoffs.
On July 11, 2013, Belinelli signed with the San Antonio Spurs.
On January 2, 2014, Belinelli scored a career-high 32 points in a 101-105 loss to the New York Knicks.
Belinelli also won the Three-Point Contest at the 2014 NBA All-Star Weekend in New Orleans, beating Bradley Beal of the Washington Wizards at the second attempt in the final after Beal equaled Belinelli's score in the initial final round.
In his first season with the Spurs, Belinelli posted career-highs percentage-wise on field goal percentage, three-point percentage, and free-throw percentage.
In Game 3 of the 2014 NBA Finals against the defending champion Miami Heat, Belinelli hit a crucial 3 pointer in the third quarter that put San Antonio's lead back to double digits after a ferocious Heat rally that evaporated San Antonio's 21 point half-time lead to a mere 7 points. Upon winning the 2014 NBA Finals, he became the first Italian player to win an NBA championship.
On July 13, 2015, Belinelli signed with the Sacramento Kings. On December 30, 2015, he scored a season-high 28 points in a loss to the Philadelphia 76ers.
