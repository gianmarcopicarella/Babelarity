The Order of Nakhimov (Russian: «Орден Нахимова») is a military decoration of the Russian Federation named in honour of Russian admiral Pavel Nakhimov (1802 - 1855) and bestowed to naval officers for outstanding military leadership. The order was established during World War II by decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of March 3, 1944. Following the 1991 dissolution of the USSR, the Order of Nakhimov was retained unchanged by decision of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation № 2424-1 of March 2, 1992 but it was not awarded in this form. The all encompassing Decree of the President of the Russian Federation № 1099 of September 7, 2010 that modernised and reorganised the entire Russian awards system away from its Soviet past amended the Order of Nakhimov to its present form, a ribbon mounted single class Order.
From its establishment in 1944 until September 2010, the Order of Nakhimov was awarded in two classes to officers of the Navy for outstanding achievements in the development, implementation and prosecution of naval operations resulting in the successful repelling of an opponent's offensive or for active fleet operations that caused considerable damage to the enemy while conserving fleet assets.
The Order of Nakhimov 1st class was awarded to naval officers for:
cleverly planned and well executed operations coordinated with all naval forces in defensive positions, which led to the destruction and harassment of numerically superior enemy naval forces;

a well planned and successfully prosecuted anti amphibious operation which resulted in the enemy suffering great losses, lowering their combat effectiveness to the point of having to abandon the landing;
successful conduct of combat operations to ensure operation of the fleet at sea, their communication and defence of bases and coastlines;
well-organized and prosecuted naval operations protecting the flank of the Red Army's active operations and naval assaults of enemy held coastlines;
The Order of Nakhimov 2nd class was awarded to naval officers for:
skilled and courageous action and personal leadership in the defence of lines of communication, bases and coastlines, which led to the destruction of large enemy forces successfully repelling the attack;
well-organized and successfully conducted de mining operations off the enemy coast, which ensured fleet operations and led to the destruction of important enemy naval assets;
well-organized and successfully conducted mine laying operations in enemy waters and near its coastlines, which assisted in the active operation of the fleet;

outstanding leadership of subordinates in battle that led to victory over a numerically superior enemy while maintaining combat effectiveness of naval assets;

The Order of Nakhimov 1st class was of multi part construction consisting of a gold five pointed star displaying radiant rays, the bottom arm pointing straight down, a silver five pointed star with each arm ending in a naval sea anchor, its upper arm pointing straight up with the rays of the gold star protruding between its arms, a central gold medallion covered with dark enamel and the gold left profile relief image of the bust of admiral Nakhimov over two laurel branches at the center of the medallion, above the admiral's head along the medallion's upper circumference, the inscription in gilt letters "ADMIRAL NAKHIMOV" (Russian: АДМИРАЛ НАХИМОВ). The hammer and sickle bisected the laurel branches on the central medallion. Five triangular red rubies were affixed to the silver star, one on each arm pointing out from the central medallion's outer edge. On the reverse of the silver star, a threaded screw and a 33 mm in diameter nut arrangement for attachment to clothing. The maker's (mint) mark was located at the upper part of the gold star's reverse, the award serial number was hand etched in the lower part. The Order of Nakhimov 2nd class was of two part construction and made entirely of silver with red enamel in lieu of rubies.
The only noticeable difference between the Soviet and early Russian Federation variants was the abrogation of the hammer and sickle from the latter.
The Order first class was awarded 82 times, including twice to naval units, such as the 1st torpedo-boat brigade of Sevastopol and the 1st Red Banner torpedo-boat brigade of the Baltic Fleet. The Order second class was awarded 469 times, including twice to naval units.
