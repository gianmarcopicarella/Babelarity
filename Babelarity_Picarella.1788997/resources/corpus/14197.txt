Pequeña Copa del Mundo (Spanish: Small World Cup) was a tournament held in Venezuela between 1952 and 1957, with a single revival in 1963 and in 1965. It was usually played by eight participants, half from Europe and half from South America. On the European side, the Latin Cup may have initially been used as a qualifying tournament. Nothing is known about the South American selection criteria. The first edition was disputed by eventual winners Real Madrid, local team La Salle FC, Brazil's Botafogo and Colombia's Millonarios. Millonarios, Corinthians and São Paulo would go on to win the next three editions, respectively, while Real Madrid and Barcelona would win the last two seasons in 1956 and 1957. After the early 1960s, the tournament rapidly lost status as the quality of the participants decreased. Also, that Small World Cup is not official.
