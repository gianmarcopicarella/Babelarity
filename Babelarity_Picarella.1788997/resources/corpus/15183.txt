The Women's 58 kg weightlifting event at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom, took place at ExCeL London on 30 July.
Total score was the sum of the lifter's best result in each of the snatch and the clean and jerk, with three lifts allowed for each lift. In case of a tie, the lighter lifter won; if still tied, the lifter who took the fewest attempts to achieve the total score won. Lifters without a valid snatch score did not perform the clean and jerk.
On 13 July 2016, IOC announced that Yuliya Kalina of Ukraine has been disqualified from the 2012 Summer Olympics and ordered to return the bronze medal from the 58 kg weightlifting event. Reanalysis of Kalina's samples from London 2012 resulted in a positive test for the prohibited substance dehydrochlormethyltestosterone (turinabol). It is unconfirmed whether the positions will be adjusted accordingly.
