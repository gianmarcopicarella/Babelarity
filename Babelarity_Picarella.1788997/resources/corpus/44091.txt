"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor" is a song by English rock band Arctic Monkeys. The song was released through Domino Records as the band's first single from their debut studio album Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006). It debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart on 23 October 2005, and remains one of the band's best known songs.
Arctic Monkeys performed the track at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics. The song was ranked at number 7 on NME's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.
The video is a live recording of the band playing the song in a studio with a small audience watching with both the video and audio taken live. The video was shot using three Ikegami 3-tube colour television cameras from the 1980s to give it a more aged effect. American band The Strokes had previously made a similar music video for their single "Last Nite"; Arctic Monkeys are known to be fans of The Strokes.
On 23 February 2006, the track won Best Track at the 2006 NME Awards - one of three awards won by Arctic Monkeys.
One of the B-sides, "Chun-Li's Spinning Bird Kick", was nominated for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in the 2007 Grammy Awards.
In October 2011, NME placed it at number 11 on its list "150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years". They later said it was the 7th-greatest song of all time on their list of the "500 Greatest Songs of All Time." 
All lyrics written by Alex Turner, all music composed by Arctic Monkeys.
The song was covered by Sugababes as a B-side to their single "Red Dress".

On 1 July 2007, Tom Jones and Joe Perry of Aerosmith performed their own version of the song at the Concert for Diana at Wembley Stadium.
In May 2007, NME magazine placed "I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor" at number 10 in its list of the 50 Greatest Indie Anthems Ever.
In February 2008, Alan Wilder, the former member of Depeche Mode, criticised the mastering of the song in an open letter on the Side-Line Magazine website. He described its sound as "a bombardment of the most unsubtle, one-dimensional noise."
The line "Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand" is a reference to Duran Duran's song "Rio". This is the first of two references to Duran Duran in the band's lyrics, the second one appearing in the song "Teddy Picker" from their second album Favourite Worst Nightmare.
The line "Dancing to electropop like a robot from 1984" may be a reference to the DJ dialogue by Patton Oswalt in the film Starsky and Hutch: "From the future of 1984, that's a funky disco robot." Some claim the lyric to be a reference to Jon McClure of Reverend and the Makers, whose previous band was called 1984.
On 27 July 2012, the band played the song at the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony.
