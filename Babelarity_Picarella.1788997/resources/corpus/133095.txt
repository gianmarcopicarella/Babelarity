Henri Schwery (born 14 June 1932) is a Cardinal and Bishop Emeritus of Sion, Switzerland.
Born in St-Léonard, Valais, Schwery studied mathematics, theoretical physics, Catholic theology, and philosophy in Sion, Rome, and Fribourg. On 7 July 1957 he was ordained priest.
From 1961 to 1977, he was part of the theological faculty of Sion, over which he presided from 1972–1977. Pope Paul VI appointed Schwery in 1977 the Bishop of Sion. He was president of the Swiss Bishops Conference from 1983–1988.
In 1991, Pope John Paul II named him a member of the College of Cardinals, becoming Cardinal-Priest of Santi Protomartiri a Via Aurelia Antica; during March of that same year, he paid his respects to the deceased Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre. He resigned the episcopal see of Sion in 1995. Schwery was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. He reached age 80 in 2012 and lost the right to participate in future conclaves.
