The gorgeted puffleg (Eriocnemis isabellae) is a hummingbird endemic to Colombia. This species was discovered in 2005, but not confirmed as a new species to science until 2007. It faces the risk of extinction, and therefore a status of Critically Endangered has been recommended. The only known habitat is the cloud forests of the Serran√≠a del Pinche (Department of Cauca), in the West Andes. The habitat is threatened by clearing forest for agriculture, especially coca farming.
The gorgeted puffleg measures between 90 and 100 millimeters (3.5 to 4 inches) in length. The name of the species is in relation to the gorget on the throat of the male, a patch of iridescent green and brilliant blue feathers, and from the puffs of white feathers at the thighs.
