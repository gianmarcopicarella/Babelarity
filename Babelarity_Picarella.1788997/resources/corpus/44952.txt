Fuck the System is the eighth album by the hardcore punk band The Exploited, released in 2002 by Dream Catcher Records. This album was available in the United States in a "clean version" with its anti-authoritarian title censored to "F*** the System" and edits made to the tracks themselves. The production value of this album is much higher than The Exploited's earlier work.
On October 14, 2003, about 500 fans of the band started a riot in Montreal, Canada after an Exploited concert was cancelled due to the band not being allowed into the country. Rioters destroyed eight cars and set them on fire; broke 11 store windows and caused other damage. The band were banned from playing in Mexico City due to the riot.
