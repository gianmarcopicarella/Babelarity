Giancarlo Antognoni, (Italian pronunciation: [dʒaŋˈkarlo antoɲˈɲoːni]; born 1 April 1954 in Marsciano) is a former Italian footballer, who played as a midfielder. A skilful and creative offensive playmaker, regarded as one the best Italian players of all time in his position, he played most of his club career with Fiorentina, where he won the Coppa Italia and the Anglo-Italian League Cup in 1975. At international level, he won the 1982 FIFA World Cup with the Italian national team, and he also represented his country at the 1978 FIFA World Cup, and at the 1980 UEFA European Championship, finishing in fourth place on both occasions. On the 11th October 2010, he was awarded the "Legends of football" Golden Foot award.
His career started in the Italian Serie D with the club of Astimacobi, when he was only sixteen. In 1972, Nils Liedholm convinced him to join Fiorentina.
He made his debut in Italian Serie A in October 1972 with Fiorentina, whom he later captained, also eventually inheriting the number 10 shirt. He won the Coppa Italia (Italian Cup) during the 1974–75 season, as well as the 1975 Anglo-Italian League Cup that season, over West Ham. He narrowly missed out on the Serie A title with Fiorentina during the 1981–82 season, losing out to rivals Juventus by a single point on the final match-day. Antognoni played 412 games with Fiorentina and scored 61 goals. Antognoni is regarded as a Fiorentina legend, and as one of the club's best ever players, as he played for the club throughout his entire Italian professional career between the 70s and 80s. He holds the record for the most appearances in Serie A for Fiorentina, with 341 appearances.
In 1987, Antognoni joined Lausanne Sports. He made 51 appearances and scored 7 goals. He retired in 1989 while at Lausanne.
Antognoni's senior international career with Italy started on the 20th November 1974, in a 3–1 away loss to the The Netherlands at the age of twenty, in a Euro 1976 qualifying match. Antognoni took part in the 1978 World Cup with Italy, where the team finished in fourth place after a semi-final defeat to the Netherlands. He also reached another fourth place finish at the 1980 European Championship on home soil, wearing the number 10 jersey. His greatest achievement with the national team came when he won the 1982 FIFA World Cup, however. Antognoni made six appearances throughout the tournament, including the semi-final match against Poland, but he was not able to participate in the final due to an injury sustained in the semi-final.
In total, he received 73 caps for Italy, scoring 7 goals. His last appearance came against Czechoslovakia, on the 16th November 1983. He captained of the national team on four occasions. Antognoni is currently the Fiorentina player with the most appearances for the national side, and also holds the record for the most appearances wearing the number 10 shirt for Italy. With two red cards throughout his international career, he is also Italy's most red carded player ever, alongside Franco Causio and Daniele De Rossi.
A skilful, quick, and creative offensive playmaker, Antognoni is considered to be one of the best Italian players of his generation, and one of the best Italian attacking midfielders of all time, due to his vision, control, technical ability, and accurate passing range. He was also an excellent dribbler, who was known for his pace and elegance on the ball, as well as his ability to keep his head up when advancing in possession. Antognoni was also highly regarded throughout his career for his accuracy from set pieces, and for his powerful shots from outside the area; he was capable of passing or striking the ball accurately with both feet.
