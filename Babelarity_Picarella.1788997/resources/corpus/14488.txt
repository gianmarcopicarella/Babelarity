Hans-Peter "Hansi" Müller (born 27 July 1957 in Stuttgart) is a former German footballer.
Playing for his hometown side VfB Stuttgart, he took part in UEFA Euro 1980 with West Germany, aged 22, after a brief taste of action at the 1978 FIFA World Cup, where he started all four games. The tournament would prove to be Müller's international peak as they emerged victorious. He had a disappointing 1982 World Cup, and despite returning to Italy to play for F.C. Internazionale Milano, he made his 42nd and last appearance for West Germany the following year.
He ended his playing career in Austria with FC Swarovski Tirol in 1990. Later he was an official ambassador for the city of Stuttgart for the 2006 FIFA World Cup and Innsbruck at UEFA Euro 2008.
