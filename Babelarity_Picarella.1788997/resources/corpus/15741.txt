Ilian Stoyanov (Bulgarian: Илиaн Стоянов) (born 20 January 1977) is a former Bulgarian football defender. In Bulgaria he is also known as Collovati, because of his haircut in the past.
He was part of the Bulgarian 2004 European Football Championship team, who exited in the first round, finishing bottom of Group C, having finished top of Qualifying Group 8 in the pre-tournament phase. In the beginning of his career, he played as left-back.
He started his professional career with CSKA Sofia in 1995.
He joined JEF United Ichihara Chiba in 2005 from Levski Sofia and enjoyed a reasonably successful first season, helping them lift the Yamazaki Nabisco Cup (the Japanese League Cup), the club's first ever trophy- and also to repeat the achievement the following season, 2006. The club released him in July 2007 after he criticised manager Amar Osim. On 12 August 2007, he signed with another Japanese club Sanfrecce Hiroshima. He could not help the team to avoid relegation to J2 in the same season. However, he helped his new team to get to the final of the Emperor's Cup in 2007, and to win the Xerox Super Cup in 2008.
In 2009, he returned to Bulgaria national team and started 7 games in 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification.
