Born in 1906, Harmel volunteered for the SS-Verfügungstruppe (Later known as Waffen-SS) in 1935. and served as a company commander in the SS-Regiment "Der Führer", with which he took part in the Battle of France in 1940.

During the summer 1944, the division moved to the Western Front, in Normandy. Harmel had been ordered to break the enemy's lines, to free the German units encircled in Falaise pocket numbering approximately 125,000 troops of the 7th Army. The operation ended with heavy losses and serious damage. Harmel was then sent to the Netherlands. He fought against the Allied offensive (Operation Market Garden) After the battles around Nijmegen, Harmel received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords on 15 December 1944.
