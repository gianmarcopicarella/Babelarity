"Highway to Hell" is the opening track of AC/DC's 1979 album Highway to Hell. It was initially released as a single in 1979.
The song was written by Angus Young, Malcolm Young and Bon Scott, with Angus Young credited for writing the guitar riff which became an instant classic. AC/DC had made several studio albums before and were constantly promoting them via a grueling tour schedule, referred to by Angus Young as being on a highway to hell.
The song's title reflects the incredibly arduous nature of touring constantly and life on the road.
The single spent 45 weeks on the German Singles Chart, even though it peaked at only No. 30, in its 19th week on that chart.
Bon Scott, whose talent as a singer and rock frontman were at a peak, was found dead in the back of a friend's car just over six months after the song was released and would never enjoy the band's incredible success that was to come.
"Highway to Hell" won the 'Most Played Australian Work Overseas' category at the 2009 APRA Awards.

"Highway to Hell" was produced by Mutt Lange as part of the album by the same name, and his work is regarded as a significant factor in delivering one of the classic AC/DC albums, the emergence of the double-guitar sound, which was later perfected on Back in Black, and improved backing vocals with Malcolm Young, joined by Cliff Williams for the first time.
"Highway to Hell" has been included on three official live albums:
Live: This was also released as a single. A video for the single was also released, containing a montage of footage from the Live at Donington home video.
