Until the year 1995 a cable ferry connected the two sides of Puumalansalmi-strait. In 1995, a 781 metres (2,562 ft) long bridge replaced the ferry. The bridge is a very dominant structure when looking Puumala town center from a distance.
Puumala has relatively good services compared to the amount of population. In the town center is situated a post office, an Alko store, a kiosk, several supermarkets and a few restaurants. The reason for the survival of these entrepreneurs is the arrival of summer inhabitants who triple the population of Puumala during the season.
In history it is remembered for being the site of a staged attack on Swedish soldiers, by men wearing Russian military uniforms, but not actually serving in the Imperial Russian Army, on the 27th June 1788. This would allow Gustav III to declare a defensive war against the Russian Empire.
