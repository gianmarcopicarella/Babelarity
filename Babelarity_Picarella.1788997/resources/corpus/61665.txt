Hofsjökull (Icelandic: “temple glacier”) is the third largest glacier in Iceland after Vatnajökull and Langjökull and the largest active volcano in the country. It is situated in the west of the Highlands of Iceland and north of the mountain range Kerlingarfjöll, between the two largest glaciers of Iceland. It covers an area of 925 km2, reaching 1,765 m (5,791 ft) at its summit. The subglacial volcano is a shield type with caldera.
Hofsjökull is the source of several rivers including the Þjórsá, Iceland's longest river.
In the southeast of Iceland, between the easternmost glacier tongue of Vatnajökull (Axajökull) and Þrándarjökull, is a smaller glacier (area about 4 km²), which is also called Hofsjökull.
In 2015, Hofsjökull has seen increase in mass.
