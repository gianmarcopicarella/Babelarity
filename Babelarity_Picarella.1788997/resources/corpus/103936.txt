Churchs Ferry is a city in Ramsey County, North Dakota, United States that has been impacted by the expansion of nearby Devils Lake. The population was 12 at the 2010 census. Churchs Ferry was founded in 1886.
Devils Lake began rising in the early 1990s, and more than 400 homes around the lake have been relocated or destroyed. This includes Churchs Ferry, one of two municipalities that have been bought out by government agencies. The other is Penn, although some people remain in both communities.
Devils Lake keeps getting larger as its outlet (Tolna Coulee) is significantly higher than the rest of the lake. In the 1880s, the lake was large enough that a man by the name of Irvine Church once operated a ferry in the area (hence the town's name), but by 1940, the lake had all but dried out. The lake is now growing back towards its maximum size again.
On January 10, 2012, Churchs Ferry residents voted 5 to 2 to remain an incorporated town.
