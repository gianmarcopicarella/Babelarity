Moyá due to an injury lost at first round in US Open. Due to his final in Australia and the last winning in Long Island, Moyá could have had a good opportunity in Flushing Meadows. Fortunately, next year he will be on top form for this date.
In 1998, Moyá won the French Open. He defeated Sébastien Grosjean, Pepe Imaz, Andrew Ilie and Jens Knippschild before beating the tournament favourite, Marcelo Ríos in the quarter final.

Later that year, he entered the French Open as defending champion and lost in the fourth round to Andre Agassi (who would go on to be that year's champion). At the US Open, Moyá withdrew in the second round with a back injury and only played in two tournaments for the rest of the year.
Despite being hampered with a stress fracture in his lower back from the 1999 US Open through the early part of 2000, Moyá still finished in the top 50 in the world for the fifth straight year.

In July 2004, Moyá's kind-hearted gesture to hit with ball boy Sandeep Ponniah at the 2004 Tennis Masters Series Toronto event captured audiences during an injury timeout against opponent Nicolas Kiefer of Germany. To the crowd's surprise, Ponniah shuffled Moyá across the baseline and received an ovation for an overhead smash on a Moyá lob.

During Wimbledon, Moyá lost in the first round to Tim Henman in a five-set thriller, the fifth set stretching to 24 games (Henman won 13–11). Despite the loss, Moyá had no points to defend (he had not played a grass-court match in a few years), resulting in his moving to world no. 20, his first time inside the top 20 since 13 June 2005.
In July 2007, Moyá won the Studena Croatia Open in Umag, Croatia, defeating Andrei Pavel, 6–4, 6–2. The win brought him to world no. 18 in the rankings, his highest rank since 23 May 2005, when he was world no. 15.

In 2008 at the Cincinnati Masters, Moyá defeated Nikolay Davydenko, 7–6, 4–6, 6–2, the match being played over the course of two days because of rain. Hours after his match with Davydenko, Moyá beat Igor Andreev, 6–4, 7–6.
Moyá made a slow start in 2009. He failed to progress beyond the second round of his first four tournaments, including a first-round loss at the Australian Open. In March 2009, he announced that he would have an indefinite hiatus from tennis to recover from injured tendons and ischium in his hip. He returned to professional tennis in January 2010, losing against Janko Tipsarević in the first round of the Chennai Open, then losing in the first round of the 2010 Australian Open to Illya Marchenko.
