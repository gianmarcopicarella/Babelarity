Robert Wielaert (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈrɔp ˈʋi.laːrt], born 29 December 1978 in Emmeloord, Flevoland) is a Dutch footballer who last played for Melbourne City.
Wielaert is a defender who was born in Emmeloord and made his debut in professional football with PSV Eindhoven in the 1997–98 season. He also played for FC Den Bosch and NEC before joining FC Twente. During his FC Twente period he was the captain of the team.
During the 2009 January transfer period he went to Ajax for a transfer fee of 3 million. However, he lost his starting position and was sent on loan to Roda JC at the start of the 2010/11 season. He signed for two seasons with Roda in the summer of 2011. After his contract had expired in 2013, Wielaert was released.
In June 2013, Wielaert was signed by Australian club Melbourne Heart in the A-League. The Dutchman had never played outside of the Netherlands and was optimistic about playing in Australia:
"I have played all of my career in the Netherlands and now it is an exciting time to play abroad. So when Melbourne Heart contacted me, I was enthusiastic immediately. The club sounds great, the city and the country too, so I am looking forward to giving everything for this club and the people around it." 
Wielaert scored his first goal for his new club and was the opening goal in the Melbourne Derby against Melbourne Victory on 25 October 2014 in front of 43,729 fans. City went on to lose the match 5-2.
