Ond≈ôej Sosenka (born 9 December 1975 in Prague) is a Czech professional cyclist who last rode for the UCI Professional Continental team PSK Whirlpool-Author. He won the Peace Race in 2002. He broke the five-year-old UCI hour record on 19 July 2005 in Moscow, Russia, riding 49.7 kilometres (30.9 mi) in one hour.
Sosenka was known as one of the largest professional cyclists competing in Europe. Standing 200 centimetres (79 in) tall, he weighs 83 to 90 kilograms and rides a track bicycle with 190 millimetres (7.5 in) cranks. For his 2005 hour record attempt, he used a custom carbon fiber bicycle manufactured by Francesco Moser cycles.
In 2006, he won the Czech Republic national time trial championships and following this the two-man time trial Duo Normand with Radek Blahut.
Sosenska was excluded from the 2001 Peace Race after failing a hematocrit test prior to the event.
In June 2008, he tested positive for the banned stimulant methamphetamine and its metabolites during his national time trial championships, and received a suspension which ended his career.
Sosenka's doping history and otherwise relatively unnotable career have caused some to cast doubt on the nature of his hour record.
