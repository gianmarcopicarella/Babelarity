The flag of Ingushetia was adopted in 1994. It shows a red triskelion symbol on a white background, with narrow green horizontal stripes above and below.
In the religion and philosophy of the Ingush people, the Solar emblem (in the center of the flag) represents not only the sun and the universe but also awareness of the oneness of the spirit in the past, present and future. The red recalls the struggle of the Ingush people for existence and in the defense of their homeland. The white symbolizes the divine purity of the thoughts and views of the nation. The green is the symbol of Islam.
