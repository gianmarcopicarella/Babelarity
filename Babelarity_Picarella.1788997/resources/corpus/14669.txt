Koufos played one season at Ohio State before being selected by the Utah Jazz with the 23rd overall pick in the 2008 NBA draft.
Koufos attended GlenOak High School in Canton, Ohio, where he played center for the GlenOak Golden Eagles high school basketball team. As a junior, Koufos averaged 24 points per game, 11.1 rebounds per game, and four blocked shots per game and he was named Second-Team All-State.
As a senior, Koufos averaged 25.9 points per game, 15.4 rebounds per game and 5.2 blocked shots per game. He was instrumental in GlenOak snapping Canton McKinley's 41-game win streak in January 2007, when he posted 32 points, 19 rebounds and 10 blocks to help the Golden Eagles edge the Bulldogs, 56–55, in overtime. The next day, Koufos recorded 32 points, 15 rebounds and seven blocks against Detroit Country Day, to lead GlenOak to its ninth consecutive victory.
Koufos finished second to future Buckeye teammate Jon Diebler in the Mr. Ohio Basketball voting. After his senior season with GlenOak, Koufos was named the Division I player of the year and was also named First-Team All-State. He also earned First-Team Northeast Inland All-District and third-team Parade All-American honors and participated in the 2007 McDonald's All-American Game and 2007 Jordan Brand Classic.
Considered a five-star recruit by Rivals.com, Koufos was listed as the No. 3 center and the No. 16 player in the nation in 2007.
In 2007, Koufos joined the Ohio State Buckeyes, where he replaced Greg Oden at center. He was named the MVP of the 2008 National Invitation Tournament (NIT) after leading the Buckeyes to the championship by defeating the UMass Minutemen by a score of 92–85.

On April 21, 2008, Koufos declared himself eligible for the 2008 NBA draft, but initially chose not to hire an agent; this would have allowed him to return to Ohio State if he withdrew from the draft on or before the June 16 withdrawal deadline. However, at the same time, it was speculated that he would leave the Buckeyes anyway to sign a professional contract in Greece. He turned down a 3-year €5 million euros net income contract offer from Olympiacos Piraeus, a Greek Basket League basketball club. On May 8, the Canton Repository reported that Koufos signed with Cleveland-based agent Mark Termini, thereby ending his college eligibility.
Koufos was selected by the NBA team Utah Jazz with the 23rd overall pick in the 2008 NBA draft. In March 2009, the Jazz assigned him to the NBA D-League club the Utah Flash. However, after the Flash's first playoff game, the Jazz recalled him from the D-League in time for the playoffs due to an injury to Jazz starting center Mehmet Okur.
Koufos was reassigned to the Flash on March 8, 2010, and recalled on March 22, 2010. On July 14, 2010, Koufos was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves in a deal involving Al Jefferson. He averaged 3.3 points and 2.2 rebounds per game in his two years in Utah. Koufos played two seasons with Utah before being traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves.
Koufos, after being traded by Utah to Minnesota for Al Jefferson, played 39 games with Minnesota before being traded again.
On February 22, 2011, Koufos was traded to the Denver Nuggets in a three-way blockbuster deal which also involved New York Knicks that brought Carmelo Anthony to New York.
On January 25, 2012, Koufos signed a three-year, $9 million extension with the Nuggets. He averaged 6.9 points and 6.1 rebounds per game in three seasons for Denver.
On June 27, 2013, Koufos was traded to the Memphis Grizzlies for Darrell Arthur and rights to the 55th pick in the 2013 NBA draft, Joffrey Lauvergne. In two seasons with Memphis, he averaged 5.8 points and 5.2 rebounds per game.
On July 13, 2015, Koufos signed with the Sacramento Kings. He averaged 6.8 points and 5.4 rebounds per game in his first season with Sacramento.
