The Greater Sunda Islands are a group of large islands within the Malay Archipelago. Many are included in present-day Indonesia: Java, smallest but by far the most populous; Sumatra in the west, directly across the Strait of Malacca from Malaysia; large Borneo, the Indonesian sector of which is called Kalimantan; and wishbone-shaped, distended Sulawesi (formerly Celebes) to the east. Under some definitions, only Java, Sumatra and Borneo are included in the Greater Sunda Islands.
Together with the Lesser Sunda Islands, they make up the Sunda Islands.
The Greater Sunda islands are mostly territory of Indonesia. However, the island of Borneo is divided among the countries of Brunei, Indonesia, and Malaysia. It contains all of Brunei, the Indonesian provinces of Central, East, West, North, and South Kalimantan, and the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak and the federal territory of Labuan.
