Enrico "Ricky" Albertosi (born 2 November 1939) is an Italian former footballer who played goalkeeper for the Italian national team in the 1966 World Cup and the 1970 World Cup, as well as in the 1968 European Championship. An eccentric, whimsical, athletic, and acrobatic keeper, with a hot temper, he is regarded as one of the greatest and most spectacular Italian goalkeepers of his generation, although at times he was occasionally criticised for his mentality.
Born in Pontremoli, at club youth level, Albertosi represented Spezia for a season, before making his debut in Serie A for Fiorentina in 1959, playing in a goalless draw with A.S. Roma. Albertosi represented Fiorentina until 1968, winning a Mitropa Cup in 1966, a European Cup Winners' Cup, and 2 Coppa Italia trophies. He later transferred to Luigi Riva's side, Cagliari Calcio, where he helped to win Cagliari's legendary first and only 1969–70 Scudetto. He later transferred to A.C. Milan in 1974, and he won yet another Serie A championship medal with the club during the 1978–79 season, along with another Coppa Italia during the 1976–77 season.
Albertosi was involved with the Italian "Totonero" betting scandal of 1980 and was ultimately suspended for 2 seasons. After Italy won the 1982 World Cup in Spain, the Italian football federation decided to let him play again. He ended his career in 1984, after playing two seasons with Elpidiense in Serie C2, at the age of 44.
Albertosi made his debut for the national team in 1961, a 4–1 victory against Argentina. His final international game took place in June 1972, when Italy drew 1–1 with Bulgaria.
Albertosi played his first World Cup with Italy in 1966, where they were surprisingly and disappointingly knocked out in the first round. In the 1970 World Cup in Mexico, Albertosi was once again Italy's starting goalkeeper. He was involved in the so-called "Game of the Century", when Italy played West Germany in the semi-final of the tournament. Despite conceding three goals in this match, Albertosi won praise for a string of acrobatic saves. He later appeared in the 1970 World Cup Final, where Italy became tournament runners-up as they lost 4–1 to Brazil.
Albertosi was also an unused squad member in the 1962 World Cup, behind Lorenzo Buffon and Carlo Mattrel, and at the 1974 World Cup, behind Dino Zoff. He was similarly an unused back-up goalkeeper behind Dino Zoff at the 1968 European Football Championship, which Italy won on home soil. In total, he played 34 times for the national team between 1961 and 1972.
