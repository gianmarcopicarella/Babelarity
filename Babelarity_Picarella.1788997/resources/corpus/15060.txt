Lars Roar Bohinen (born 8 September 1969 in Vadsø) is a Norwegian former professional footballer who played as a midfielder from 1986 until 2005 notably in the English Premier League for Nottingham Forest, Blackburn Rovers and Derby County.
His first professional club was Vålerenga, and he played for Viking, Young Boys Bern, Nottingham Forest, Blackburn Rovers, Derby County and Lyngby F.C..
Bohinen is perhaps most well known in England for his time with Nottingham Forest. He moved from BSC Young Boys to Frank Clark's Nottingham Forest for a £450,000 fee in 1993. He joined Forest at a time when they were struggling in the first division of English Football, and a clause in his contract meant that he could leave at any time if another club matched a £700,000 buyout fee. After gaining promotion to the Premier League with Forest, Bohinen stayed there for another season which included some famous goals for the Norwegian, most notably a 30-yard lob at White Hart Lane in a 1–4 victory for Forest against Tottenham Hotspur. In 1995 English champions Blackburn matched the £700,000 buyout clause in his contract and Bohinen moved to Ewood park, signing a three-year contract.
Bohinen joined Derby County from Blackburn in March 1998 for £1.45 million. He had his contract cancelled by the club in January 2001, having scored just once in a 3–1 away defeat against Crystal Palace in April 1998.
He made his debut for the Norwegian national team in 1989 and earned 49 caps, scoring 10 goals. He once refused to play for the Norwegian national team against France in protest after the French Army started carrying out nuclear tests in the South Pacific.
After he retired from footballing, Bohinen became assistant coach for Vålerenga in Oslo, Norway, but later quit the job. He later became sporting director in Stabæk, but resigned in April 2009.
In 2011, Bohinen finished third on the television show Skal vi danse?, the Norwegian version of Strictly Come Dancing.
Lars Bohinen is a cousin of Sigurd Rushfeldt.
