The black-and-white mannikin or black-and-white munia (Lonchura bicolor) is a species of estrildid finch found in western and central Africa. It has an estimated global extent of occurrence of 4,200,000 km2. It is found in moist savanna and subtropical/tropical lowland moist forest habitat. The status of the species is evaluated as least concern. They are seedeaters, but are known to feed on algae.
Origin and phylogeny has been obtained by Antonio Arnaiz-Villena et al. Estrildinae may have originated in India and dispersed thereafter (towards Africa and Pacific Ocean habitats).
