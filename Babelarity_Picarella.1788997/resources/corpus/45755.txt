Red Fang is an American heavy metal band from Portland, Oregon, formed in 2005. It is composed of guitarist and vocalist Bryan Giles, bassist and vocalist Aaron Beam, guitarist David Sullivan and drummer John Sherman. The band has released three studio albums: Red Fang in 2009, Murder the Mountains in 2011 and Whales and Leeches in 2013.
Red Fang started out on Wantage USA Records in Montana, where the band released its self-titled LP. Red Fang's 2009 debut for record label Sargent House/WANTAGE USA combined its first two releases, which were limited-release EPs. The band followed this debut with Murder the Mountains, released on Relapse Records in 2011 produced by Chris Funk. Red Fang also appeared on 2011's Metalliance tour alongside the bands Crowbar and Helmet; the same year, Red Fang opened the Jägermeister stage on 2011's edition of the annual Rockstar Energy Drink Mayhem Festival which also featured headliners Megadeth, Godsmack, and Disturbed.
On September 12, 2011, Red Fang was announced as one of the openers (the other being The Dillinger Escape Plan) for Mastodon's 2011 and 2012 tours in the United States and Europe respectively. Later in 2012, Red Fang embarked on a European headlining tour with Black Tusk, performing for the first time in various countries including Russia, Ukraine, and Greece.
In February 2013, Red Fang traveled to Australia to play the Australian Soundwave Festival and also performed sideshows with stoner rock bands Kyuss Lives and Orange Goblin.
The band performed on Late Show with David Letterman in January 2014 after its 2013 release "Whales and Leeches" peaked at No. 66 on Billboard's Top 200. The show's musical director Paul Shaffer sat in with Red Fang, playing organ during the band's performance of "Blood Like Cream."
On August 13, 2014, Red Fang was announced as the opening act for a December 2014 North American tour by Swedish metal bands Opeth and In Flames.
