Dominique Rocheteau (French pronunciation: ​[dɔminik ʁɔʃəto]; born 14 January 1955 in Saintes, Charente-Maritime) is a former international football striker from France. He played – and scored – in three World Cups and was part of the team that won the European Championship in 1984. At club level, he won 4 Ligue 1 titles, 3 French Cups and played a European Cup final.
Rocheteau began his professional career with AS Saint-Étienne, when they were the most successful and popular football team in France. He was a sinuous and incisive outside right who was nicknamed l'Ange Vert ("The Green Angel"). Injured, he played only the last eight minutes of the 1976 European Cup Final, which Saint-Étienne lost 1-0 to Bayern Munich. He won three French Championships (1974–1976) and one French Cup (1977) with Saint-Étienne. He transferred to Paris St. Germain in 1980 with whom he won once more the French Championship (1986) and two more French Cups (1982–1983). In 1987 he was transferred to Toulouse FC, for whom he played two seasons before retiring in 1989.
Asked in 2012 about his most memorable football moment, Rocheteau cited his 112th-minute decisive goal against Kiev in the 1976 Champions League quarter-finals. Saint-Étienne had lost the first leg 2-0 but won the return match 3-0 after extra-time. Kiev were the previous year's winners of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup.
With the French National Team Rocheteau won 49 caps from 1975–1986 and scored 15 goals. He played in the 1978 World Cup, 1982 World Cup and 1986 World Cup and was part of the team that won the European Championship in 1984 (though Rocheteau missed the final due to injury). He was injury prone.
Rocheteau played two matches and scored once in Argentina 1978, where France were eliminated in the group stage. Four years later in Spain, he played four matches and scored twice. He started for France in their semi-final defeat against West Germany, and was still on the field for the penalty shooutout, successfully converting his kick. In Mexico 1986, Rocheteau scored only one goal but made four assists. He played four matches, including the quarter-finals against Brazil, but was injured during extra-time and missed the penalty shootout and the semi-finals.
Rocheteau grew up in Étaules, Charente-Maritime where his grandfather and father ran an oyster farm. The business was later taken over by his brother Antony.
After his retirement, Rocheteau shortly became a sports agent, working for David Ginola and Reynald Pedros. In 2002, he became head of the National Ethics Committee of the French Football Federation. He joined the Saint-Étienne staff in 2010, and has since held various management positions in the club.
Away from football, Rocheteau has been noted for his far left views, and has been associated with the Ligue communiste révolutionnaire and Lutte Ouvrière. In 1995, he played a supporting fictional character in Maurice Pialat's film Le Garçu, starring Gérard Depardieu. He has appeared in a few other movies, TV shows and commercials.
