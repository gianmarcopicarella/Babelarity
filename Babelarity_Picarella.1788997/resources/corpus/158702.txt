Arvier is a town and comune in the Aosta Valley region of northwestern Italy.
The local wine, Enfer d'Arvier, had its own DOC designation before being subsumed into the Valle d'Aosta DOC. It is a blend made primarily from the Petit Rouge grape with lesser amounts of Dolcetto, Gamay, Neyret, Pinot noir, and/or Vien de Nus.
Arvier was the birthplace of Maurice Garin, the winner of the original Tour de France in 1903. His family migrated to Northern France in 1885.
