National Taiwan University (NTU; Chinese: 國立臺灣大學; pinyin: Guólì Táiwān Dàxué; colloquially, 台大; Táidà; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Tâi-tāi) is a national co-educational research university located in Taipei, Taiwan. Its 1,086,167 m2 main campus is located in Taipei's Da'an District. In addition, the university has 6 other campuses in Taipei and elsewhere, with a total area of 345,830,000 m2. The University consists of 11 colleges, 54 departments, 103 graduate institutes and 4 research centers. In 2015, the student body consisted of 16,533 undergraduate students and 15,225 graduate students.
The university was founded in 1928 by the Japanese administration during the Japanese colonial era and was then known as the Taihoku Imperial University. After World War II, the government of the Republic of China resumed the administration of the University, reorganizing and renaming it National Taiwan University on November 15, 1945.
NTU is considered one of the most prestigious universities in Taiwan. It also has strong ties with the Academia Sinica in Taiwan in the form of research and teaching collaborations and a joint program office.
National Taiwan University has its origins in the Taihoku Imperial University (Japanese: 臺北帝國大學, Hepburn: Taihoku Teikoku Daigaku) founded by Taiwan's Japanese colonial government in 1928 as a member of the imperial university system administered by the Empire of Japan.
The school's first president was Taira Shidehara. The Taihoku Imperial University began with a Faculty of Liberal Arts and Law and a Faculty of Science and Agriculture serving 60 students. The university was intended mainly for Japanese nationals; few Taiwanese students were admitted. The Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Engineering were added in 1935 and 1943, respectively.
After World War II the government of the Republic of China reorganized the school as an institution for Chinese-speaking students. The school was renamed National Taiwan University on 15 November 1945 and Lo Tsung-lo was appointed as its president. In 1962, joint projects with the Academia Sinica were initiated. An evening division was established in 1967. Between 1972 and 1975, the Philosophy Department Incident took place during the White Terror period authoritarian rule, resulting in the dismissal of several professors.
A new university library opened in 1998. In 1999, the evening division and the Center of Continuing Education merged to form the Division of Continuing Education & Professional Development. Lee Si-Chen, the current president, took office in 2005.
NTU is a member of the Association of Pacific Rim Universities and the Association of East Asian Research Universities.. The university offers bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, and doctorate degrees in many disciplines. Students are able to select courses offered by any of the colleges; however, compulsory subjects designated for each major needs to be completed to be awarded a degree. A student must declare a major during college application, some majors are more competitive than others and require a higher national examination score. In recent years, medicine, electrical engineering, law, and finance have been the most selective majors. Most majors take four years to complete while the dental and the medical degree take six and seven years to finish, respectively.
NTU requires most of its undergraduate students to take a mandatory core curriculum, comprising Chinese, freshman English, physical education, and public service. The medical school in addition dictates each of its students to take philosophy and sociology classes as well as seminars in ethics and thanatology. Military training is no longer an obligatory course for male students, but it is a prerequisite if they plan to apply to become officers during their compulsory military service.
The total number of students, including those enrolled at the School of Professional and Continuing Studies, has grown to over 33,000, including over 17,000 university students and 15,000 graduate students. The university staff and students produced over 5000 research publications in 2010.
The president heads the university. Each college is headed by a dean, and each department by a chairman. Students elect their own representatives each year to attend administrative meetings.
NTU comprises 11 colleges: bio-resources and agriculture, electrical engineering and computer science, engineering, law, liberal arts, life science, management, medicine, public health, science, and social sciences.
The International Chinese Language Program (ICLP), founded by Stanford University, is located at National Taiwan University.

Thomson Scientific’s Web of Knowledge said this action is a severe abuse of the scientific publishing system.
