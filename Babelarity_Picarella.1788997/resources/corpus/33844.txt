Violales is a botanical name of an order of flowering plants and takes its name from the included family Violaceae. The name has been used in several systems, although some systems used the name Parietales for similar groupings. In the 1981 version of the influential Cronquist system, order Violales was placed in subclass Dilleniidae with a circumscription consisting of the families listed below. Some classifications such as that of Dahlgren placed the Violales in the superorder Violiflorae (also called Violanae).
The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system does not recognize order Violales; Violaceae is placed in order Malpighiales and the other families are reassigned to various orders as indicated.
