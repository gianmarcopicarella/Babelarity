Víctor Lidio Jara Martínez (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈbiktoɾ ˈliðjo ˈxaɾa maɾˈtines]; 28 September 1932 – 15 September 1973) was a Chilean teacher, theatre director, poet, singer-songwriter, and political activist. A distinguished theatre director, he developed Chilean theatre by directing a broad array of works, ranging from locally produced Chilean plays, to the classics of the world stage, to the experimental work of such playwrights as Ann Jellicoe. He also played a pivotal role among neo-folkloric musicians who established the Nueva Canción Chilena (New Chilean Song) movement; this led to an uprising of new sounds in popular music during the administration of Salvador Allende.
Shortly after the Chilean coup of 11 September 1973, Jara was arrested; he was tortured under interrogation and ultimately shot dead. His body was later thrown out into the street of a shanty town in Santiago. The contrast between the themes of his songs, on love, peace and social justice and the brutal way in which he was murdered transformed Jara into a "potent symbol of struggle for human rights and justice" for those killed during the Pinochet regime.
In June 2016, former Chilean army officer Pedro Barrientos was found liable for Jara's murder by a Florida jury.
Víctor Jara was born in 1932 in the locality of Lonquén, near the city of Santiago, to poor peasants Manuel Jara and Amanda Martínez. His father Manuel was illiterate and encouraged his children to work from an early age to help the family survive, rather than to attend school. By the age of 6, Jara was already working on the land. His father could not support his family on earnings as a peasant at the Ruiz-Tagle estate, nor was he able to find stable work to support his large family. As he took to drinking, he became increasingly violent. His relationship with his wife deteriorated, and Manuel left the family to look for work when Víctor was still a child.
Amanda Martínez persevered in raising Víctor and his siblings; she insisted that each get a good education. A mestiza with deep Araucanian roots in the south of Chile, she was self-taught; she played the guitar and the piano. She also performed as a singer, with a repertory of traditional folk songs she used for local functions like weddings and funerals.
Jara's mother died when Jara was 15, leaving him to make his own way. He began to study to be an accountant, but soon moved into a seminary, where he studied for the priesthood. After a couple of years, however, he became disillusioned with the Church and left the seminary. Subsequently he spent several years in army service before returning to his home town to pursue interests in folk music and theatre.
Jara was deeply influenced by the folklore of Chile and other Latin American countries; he was particularly influenced by artists such as Violeta Parra, Atahualpa Yupanqui, and the poet Pablo Neruda. Jara began his foray into folklore in the mid-1950s when he began singing with the group Cuncumen. In the 1960s, he started specializing in folk music, and got to sing at Santiago's La Peña de Los Parra, owned by Ángel Parra. Through these activities, Jara became greatly involved in the la Nueva Canción Chilena movement of Latin American folk music. He published his first recording in 1966 and, by 1970, had left his theatre work in favour of a career in music. His songs were drawn from a combination of traditional folk music and left-wing political activism. From this period, some of his most renowned songs are Plegaria a un Labrador ("Prayer to a Worker") and Te Recuerdo Amanda ("I Remember You Amanda"). He supported the Unidad Popular ("Popular Unity") coalition candidate Salvador Allende for the presidency of Chile, taking part in campaigning, volunteer political work, and playing free concerts.
Jara's origins in political activism started soon after he joined the choir at the University of Chile. Convinced by a choir-mate to pursue a career in theatre, Jara subsequently joined his university's theatre program, earning him a scholarship for talent. Appearing in several of the university's plays, he gravitated towards those with social themes, such as Russian playwright Maxim Gorky's The Lower Depths, a depiction of the hardships of lower-class life. In 1957 Jara met with Chilean folksinger Violeta Parra. It was Parra who steered folk music in Chile away from the rote reproduction of rural materials toward modern song composition rooted in traditional forms. Parra tried to incorporate folk music into the everyday life of modern Chileans, establishing musical community centers called peñas. Jara absorbed these lessons and joined a folk group called Cuncumén, with whom he continued his explorations of Chile's traditional music. Jara continued his theatre career as a director for nine years, before he became more passionate about music.
Jara released his first album, Canto a lo humano , in 1966. Early in his recording career he showed a knack for antagonizing conservative Chileans, releasing a traditional comic song called "La beata" that depicted a religious woman with a crush on the priest to whom she goes for confession. The song was banned on radio stations and removed from record shops, but the controversy only added to Jara's reputation among young and progressive Chileans. More serious in the eyes of the Chilean right wing was Jara's growing identification with the leftist social movement led by socialist politician Salvador Allende. After visits to Cuba and the Soviet Union in the early 1960s, Jara had joined the Communist Party. The personal met the political in Jara's songs about the poverty he had experienced firsthand.
Jara's songs spread outside Chile and were known to and performed by American folk artists. His popularity was due not only to his songwriting skills but also to his exceptional power as a performer. Jara took a decisive turn toward political confrontation with his song "Preguntas por Puerto Montt" (Questions About Puerto Montt, 1969), which took direct aim at a government official who had ordered police to attack squatters in the town of Puerto Montt. The Chilean political situation deteriorated after the official was assassinated, and right-wing thugs beat up Jara on one occasion.
Jara composed "Venceremos" (We Will Triumph), the theme song of Allende's Unidad Popular (Popular Unity) movement, and he welcomed Allende's election to the Chilean presidency in 1970. Jara and his wife were key participants in a cultural renaissance that swept Chile, organizing cultural events that supported the country's new socialist government. He set poems by Chilean writer Pablo Neruda to music and performed at a ceremony honoring Neruda after the famous writer received the Nobel Prize for literature in 1972. Throughout rumblings of a right-wing coup, Jara held on to his teaching job at Chile's Technical University. Jara's popular success during this time as both a musician and communist earned him a concert in Moscow. So successful was he that the Soviet Union even tried to latch onto his popularity, claiming in their media that his vocal prowess was the result of surgery he had undergone while in Moscow.
Jara's role in Chilean society was not limited to his musical output. A supporter of the Popular Unity party, Jara publicly spoke on Salvador Allende's behalf. Allende's campaign was successful and, in 1970, he was elected president of Chile. Jara continued to actively support Allende as president, frequently speaking in support of Allende and playing an important role in the new administration's efforts to reorient Chilean culture.
The Chilean right wing believed that Allende was too far to the political left. Backed by the United States, which opposed Allende's socialist politics, the right staged a coup d'état on September 11, 1973 through the Chilean military and judiciary, resulting in the death of Salvador Allende. At the moment of the coup, Jara was on the way to the Technical University (today Universidad de Santiago), where he was a teacher. That night he slept at the university along with other teachers and students, and sang to raise morale.
On the morning of 12 September, Jara was taken as a prisoner by the military, along with thousands of others deemed suspect, and interned as a prisoner in the Chile Stadium in September 1973. His body was later discarded outside the stadium along with other civilian prisoners who had been killed by the Chilean Army.
Jara's wife, Joan Jara, was allowed to come and retrieve his body from the site and was able to confirm the physical damage he had endured. After holding a funeral for her husband, Joan Jara fled the country in secret. Joan Turner Jara currently lives in Chile and runs the Víctor Jara Foundation. Before his death, Jara wrote a poem about the conditions of the prisoners in the stadium. The poem was written on a piece of paper that was hidden inside the shoe of a friend. The poem was never named, but is commonly known as "Estadio Chile". (The Chile Stadium, also known as the Víctor Jara Stadium, is often confused with the Estadio Nacional (National Stadium).)
Forty two years later former Chilean military officers were charged with his murder.
On 16 May 2008, retired colonel Mario Manriquez Bravo, who was chief of security at Chile Stadium as the coup was carried out, would be the first to be convicted in Jara's death. Chilean Judge Juan Eduardo Fuentes, who oversaw Bravo's conviction, then decided to close the case. Jara's family soon appealed this decision.
In June 2008, Judge Fuentes re-opened the investigation into Jara's death. Judge Fuentes said he would examine 40 new pieces of evidence provided by the singer's family.
On 28 May 2009, José Adolfo Paredes Márquez, a 54-year-old former Army conscript, arrested the previous week in San Sebastian, Chile, was formally charged with Jara's murder.
Following Paredes' arrest, on 1 June 2009, the police investigation identified the name of the officer who first shot Víctor Jara in the head. The officer played Russian roulette with Jara, by placing a single round in his revolver, spinning the cylinder, placing the muzzle against Jara's head and pulling the trigger. The officer repeated this a couple of times, until a shot fired and Víctor fell to the ground. The officer then ordered two conscripts (one of them Paredes) to finish the job, by firing into Jara's body. A judge ordered Jara's body to be exhumed in an effort to determine more information regarding his death.
On 3 December 2009, a massive funeral took place in the Galpón Víctor Jara across from Plaza Brasil. Jara's remains were honoured by thousands. His remains were re-buried in the same place he was buried in 1973.
On 28 December 2012 a judge in Chile ordered the arrest of eight former army officers for alleged involvement in the murder of Víctor Jara. He issued an international arrest warrant for one of them, Pedro Barrientos Núñez, accused of shooting Jara in the head during a torture session Barrientos lives in Florida.
On 4 September 2013, Chadbourne & Parke attorneys Mark D. Beckett  and Christian Urrutia, with the assistance of the Center for Justice and Accountability filed suit in US court against Pedro Barrientos, who currently resides in Florida, on behalf of Víctor Jara's widow and children. The suit accuses Pedro Barrientos of arbitrary detention; cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; extrajudicial killing; and crimes against humanity under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS); and of torture and extrajudicial judicial killing under the Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA), in connection with the death of Víctor Jara. The complaint alleges that Barrientos is liable for Víctor Jara's death as a direct perpetrator, as well as a commander, and an indirect collaborator to the crimes at Chile Stadium.
Paragraph 23- On 11 September 1973, Chilean Army troops from the Arica Regiment of the Chilean Arma from La Serena attacked the University. Troops prohibited civilians from entering or leaving the University premises. During the afternoon of 12 September 1973, military personnel entered the University and illegally detained hundreds of professors, students, and administrators.
Paragraph 24- Víctor Jara was among those arbitrarily detained on the campus and, thereafter, was transferred to the Stadium, where he was ultimately tortured and killed.
Paragraph 32- In the course of transporting and processing the civilian prisoners, Captain Fernando Polanco Gallardo, a commanding officer in military intelligence, recognized Víctor Jara as the well-known folk singer whose popular songs addressed social inequality and who had supported President Allende's government. Captain Polanco then separated Víctor Jara from the group and beat Víctor Jara severely. He then transferred Víctor Jara, together with some of the other civilians, to the Stadium.
Paragraph 35-Throughout his detention in the locker room of the Stadium, Víctor Jara was in the physical custody of Lieutenant Barrientos, soldiers under his command, or other members of the Chilean Army who acted in furtherance of the Chilean Army's common plan, design, and scheme to commit human rights abuses against civilians at the Stadium.
Paragraph 43- The arbitrary detention, torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and extrajudicial killing inflicted upon Víctor Jara and other detainees at the Stadium were part of a widespread and systematic attack of the civilian population by the Chilean Army in the days following the military coup from 11 September 1973 through 15 September 1973. Lieutenant Barrientos knew or should have known about the widespread and systematic attacks against the civilian population if for no other reason than because he was present for and participated in the attacks carried out against civilians at the Stadium.
On 15 April 2015 a US judge ordered Barrientos to stand trial in Florida. During the trial the Jara family was represented by Chadbourne & Parke attorneys Mark D. Beckett, Christian Urrutia, Center for Justice and Accountability attorneys Kathy Roberts and Daniel Mclaughlin, and Lowndes, Drosdick, Doster, Kantor & Reed attorney Richard Dellinger. On 27 June 2016, a former Chilean military official (was) found liable for killing of Victor Jara. The BBC and The Guardian newspaper reported that a "Florida jury awards $28m in verdict that could lead to Pedro Pablo Barrientos Nuñez's extradition to face criminal charges over 1973 killing of folk singer."
(Guardian online)[1] "Former Chilean military official found liable for killing of Victor Jara" -Accusers said Barrientos, 67, who now lives in Deltona, Florida, shot dead Jara, 40, in September 1973 after three days of beatings while the socialist-leaning theatre director and university lecturer was among thousands of suspected communists and subversives detained in Santiago’s soccer stadium.
Barrientos, who fled Chile in 1989 and became a US citizen through marriage, was one of nine retired army officers indicted for murder in his homeland four years ago but the US Department of Justice has not responded to a request by the Chilean government for his return."
"The jury of five women and one man deliberated for nine hours before determining that Barrientos, a Pinochet loyalist who commanded the Chilean army’s notorious Tejas Verde brigade, should pay $6m in compensatory damages and a further $22m in punitive damages. The jury found him liable on both counts of the civil indictment, for torture and extrajudicial killing. The Jara family, however, are unlikely to see any payment. Barrientos’ lawyer Luis Calderon painted a picture during the trial of a poor retiree who lives in a modest two-bedroom house and drives around in a decade-old car, and who was forced to work as a cook at a fast-food restaurant for years just to make ends meet."
“One of the things the Jara family has been pursuing for 43 years is just the truth. Barrientos said in deposition he knew nothing of Chile Stadium, he knew nothing of Victor Jara, but we had conscript after conscript saying he was there and he was responsible for what took place.” One of the conscripts, Jose Navarette Barra, said during the trial in video testimony from Chile that Barrientos boasted of what he had done. “He said many times that he killed Victor Jara,” Barra said. “He talked about killing a communist, and he didn’t want a communist in Chile.”
(BBC online) [2] "Former Chile officer found liable for Victor Jara death" -A Florida jury has found a former Chilean army officer liable for the murder of the popular folk singer and activist, Victor Jara in 1973. It found that Pedro Pablo Barrientos killed the folk singer in the first days of Augusto Pinochet's coup. The jury at the civil trial in Orlando awarded Jara's family $28m (£21m) in damages.
More than 3,000 people were killed or went missing between 1973 and 1990, when Pinochet's dictatorship ended. The lawsuit against Mr Barrientos, who now lives in Florida, was brought by Jara's widow Joan and his daughter Amanda. The singer was a well-known figure in Chile during the 1960s and 70s. He wrote protest songs about Chile's ruling elite and was a supporter of leftist President Salvador Allende, who died during the military uprising. Jara's body was exhumed in 2009 and later reburied, with thousands of Chileans paying their respects. Several other former army officers have faced trial over his killing in Chile.
Although the military dictatorship burned the majority of master recordings of Jara's music, Joan Jara managed to get recordings out of Chile; these were later copied and distributed worldwide. The widow later wrote an account of Víctor Jara's life and music, titled Víctor: An Unfinished Song.
Named by Rolling Stone magazine as one of the fifteen foremost protest artists.
On 22 September 1973, the Soviet/Russian astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh named a newly found asteroid 2644 Víctor Jara, in honor of Víctor Jara's life and artistic work.
American folksinger Phil Ochs, who met and performed with Jara during a tour of South America, organized a benefit concert in his memory in New York in 1974. Titled "An Evening With Salvador Allende", the concert featured Bob Dylan, Pete Seeger, Arlo Guthrie and Ochs.
For Neruda, for Chile contains a section called "The Chilean Singer", with poems dedicated to Jara.
An East German biographical movie called El Cantor (the Singer) was made in 1978. It was directed by Jara's friend Dean Reed, who also played the part of Jara. That same year, the Dutch-Swedish singer-songwriter Cornelis Vreeswijk released an album of Victor Jara songs translated by him into Swedish, Cornelis sjunger Victor Jara ("Cornelis sings Victor Jara").
In the late 1990s British actress Emma Thompson started to work on a screenplay, which she planned to use as the basis for a movie about Víctor Jara. Thompson, a human rights activist and fan of Jara, considered the political murder of the Chilean artist as a symbol of human rights violation in Chile. She believed a movie about Jara's life and death would make more people aware of the Chilean tragedy. The movie would feature Antonio Banderas – another fan of Víctor Jara – as Jara himself where he would sing some of his songs and Emma Thompson as Víctor Jara's British wife Joan Jara. The project has not yet been made into a film.
UK poet Adrian Mitchell translated Jara's poems and lyrics. He wrote the tribute 'Victor Jara', which singer Arlo Guthrie later set to music.
The Soviet musician Alexander Gradsky created the rock opera, Stadium (Стадион, Stadion) (1985), based on the events surrounding Jara's death.
Portuguese folk band Brigada Víctor Jara is named after him.
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band's Wrecking Ball Tour made a stop in Chile on 12 September 2013 (Springsteen's first ever performance in the country), just days before the 40th anniversary of Jara's death. Springsteen and guitarist Nils Lofgren paid tribute to Jara by covering his song, "Manifiesto," which Springsteen sang in Spanish.
In a short speech before the song, Springsteen said (in Spanish): "In 1988 we played for Amnesty International in Mendoza, Argentina, but Chile was in our hearts. We met many families of Desaparecidos, which had pictures of their loved ones. It was a moment that stays with me forever. A political musician, Víctor Jara, remains a great inspiration. It’s a gift to be here and I take it with humbleness."
Victor Jara, pioneer of the Nueva Cancion Chilena movement and leftist political activist, remained true to his ideology right up to the moment of his death. He was tortured and murdered days after Salvador Allende; Chile’s democratically elected president. On 16 September 1973, just a few days before his birthday, Victor Jara had his hands broken after already having suffered other forms of torture while being held captive in the Chile Stadium. The Pinochet regime had successfully overthrown Allende in a coup aided by the United States. Pinochet’s soldiers had rounded up many people who were believed to be politically involved with the leftist parties and Allende’s Popular Unity (UP), Jara being one of them. The guards at the Chile Stadium tortured and mocked Jara by asking him to play guitar after he had his hands and fingers smashed. Soon after, he was killed by being shot to the head and having his body riddeled with over 40 bullets His body was displayed at the entrance of Chile Stadium for other prisioners to see. Eventually, his body was dumped near a cementary. It was found by civil servants and brought to a morgue, where a civil servant identified his body and contacted Joan Jara. She took his body and gave him a quick and clandestine burial in the general cemetery before she fled the country into exile. This was the best she could do under such brutal circumstances and in the small amount of time she had. She made sure to take recordings of Jara’s music to later make copies and distribute. Today, Victor Jara’s music is world known and he is recognized as a political figure. His music began to resurface in Chile in 1981, shortly after the coup in 1973. Nearly eight hundred cassettes, of early nonpolitical Jara songs were confiscated on the "grounds that they violated an internal security law." The importer was given jail time and released six months later due to lack of merit. Victor Jara’s records were being openly sold throughout Santiago, Chile by 1982. By this point, everyone already assumed that Jara had been murdered by the Pinochet regime. In 2009, Jara’s body was exhumed in order to discover exactly what had happened to him. Many officers were being charged for having some participation in his murder. As of 2013, ten officials have been charged for Jara’s murder. The intentions of the 2013 lawsuit by Jara’s family were against Pedro Barrientos Nuñez for delivering the fatal bullet into Victor Jara’s head. The lawsuit says that Barrientos Nuñez is responsible for personally firing the final shot into the back of Jara’s head as part of Barrientos Nuñez game of Russian roulette. Peter Kornbluh, author of The Pinochet File: A Declassified Dossier on Atrocity and Accountability, stated, "I hope that the Jara family will prevail and that the U.S. government understands that it must expel Pedro Barrientos to Chile to join these others who’ve been indicted… otherwise the United States will be seen as harboring one of the key culprits in the murder of Victor Jara. Barrientos Nuñez is still living Florida, United States, since 1989. The case of Jara is one of the many in which families of desaparecidos (people disappeared by the Pinochet government and most likely tortured and killed) are still struggling to get justice for. Victor Jara received a proper burial thirty-six years after his first burial. After being exhumed, he received an emotional burial on 3 December 2009 in Santiago, Chile. Thousands of Chileans went to Jara’s funeral to pay their respects. Jara’s widow led the funeral cortege in what was the second time she buried her husband. Chile’s president in 2009, Michelle Bachelet, spoke in regards to Jara’s funeral, she said, "Finally after 36 years, Victor can rest in peace. Bachelet was also a victim of the Pinochet regime and spent years in exile. He is a hero for the left and he is known worldwide even though he continues buried in the general cemetery where his widow originally buried him. Not only do Latin American artists commemorate him but also global artists such as U2 and The Clash, which have also paid homage to him. U2 has given concerts at the stadium not only as homage to Jara but also for the many that suffered under the Pinochet dictatorship. Jara’s face is still featured on posters throughout Chile. Today the stadium in which Jara and many others were held captive and tortured still stands. It is often referred to as the Victor Jara Stadium There is a Victor Jara Foundation which was founded by Jara’s wife and children and legally established on 4 October 1994. The Foundation is a non-profit, cultural organization with the purpose of promoting and continuing Jara’s work.

The German hip hop band Freundeskreis mention Jara in their song "Leg dein Ohr auf die Schiene der Geschichte" ("Put your ear on the rails of history") published in 1997: "...C.I.A. - Chile ist amerikanisch, Victor Jara sang auf spanisch, seine Stimme mahnt Dich: Vergiss die Toten nicht, vergiss die Diktatur Despoten nicht, 1973..." ("...C.I.A. - Chile is American, Victor Jara sang in Spanish, his voice reminds/urges you: Do not forget the dead, do not forget the despots of dictatorship, 1973..."). After the word "spanisch," a short sample of Jara singing is inserted.
In Suren Tsormudian's "Ancestral Heritage" ("Наследие предков", Nasledye pryedkov), a 2012 entry to the Universe of Metro 2033, Victor Jara's fate is mentioned, but the book repeats the common mistake that it was Estadio Nacional that was named after him.
