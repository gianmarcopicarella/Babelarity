The 1960 Portuguese Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Circuito da Boavista, Oporto on 14 August 1960. It was the eighth race of the 1960 Formula One season.
Scottish racing legend Jim Clark scored his first ever Formula One podium at this race.
Because many British teams pulled out of the Italian Grand Prix, Brabham won the World Championship here.
This was to be the last Portuguese Grand Prix until 1984.
Stirling Moss was disqualified by the officials because he drove against the direction of the race while trying to get going after a spin.
Notes: Only the top five positions are included for both sets of standings. Only the best 6 results counted towards each Championship. Numbers without parentheses are Championship points; numbers in parentheses are total points scored.
