In a record-setting match spanning three days, 23rd seed John Isner, attempting to win his first ever match at Wimbledon, faced off against qualifier Nicolas Mahut in the first round, on 22–24 June. With the score at 6–4, 3–6, 6–7(7), 7–6(3), 59–59, the match was suspended due to darkness for the second straight day after a total of 9 hours and 58 minutes. Isner had already served a world record 98 aces by that time, with Mahut scoring 94 aces, both breaking Ivo Karlović's previous record of 78. The second day's play alone was at 7 hours 8 mins, longer than the longest previous complete match, and is therefore also the longest session of tennis played in a single day. Isner eventually defeated Mahut 6–4, 3–6, 6–7(7), 7–6(3), 70–68. The match lasted 11 hours and 5 minutes, and the fifth set alone lasted 8 hours and 11 minutes. The match has been noted as officially the longest match ever in a tennis Open in terms of both times and games, beating the previous record set by (respectively) Pancho Gonzales defeating Charlie Pasarell in 112 games in 1969 at Wimbledon in the first round (before the introduction of the tie-break), as well as the match between Frenchmen Fabrice Santoro and Arnaud Clément at the 2004 French Open, which lasted 6 hours and 33 minutes. Time magazine named this match one of the Top 10 Sports Moments of 2010.
Elizabeth II visited Wimbledon on Thursday 24 June, her first visit to the annual tennis tournament in 33 years. The last time the Queen had attended the championships was in 1977, when she watched British player Virginia Wade win the ladies' singles title. Arriving shortly after 11 am, the Queen's visit included a tour of the grounds and an observation session of the All England Club's Wimbledon Junior Tennis Initiative on Court 14, before moving to the Members' Lawn where she greeted a line-up of players: the defending champions in singles Serena Williams and Roger Federer, multiple-time Wimbledon champions Martina Navratilova, Billie Jean King and Venus Williams, and a selection of top professionals that consisted of Caroline Wozniacki, Jelena Janković, Novak Djokovic and Andy Roddick. She also met four British women's tennis players: Heather Watson, Elena Baltacha, Anne Keothavong and Laura Robson. Following that, she walked across the bridge to Centre Court, where she later had lunch in the Clubhouse with a selection of former and current tennis players. She finished her visit by watching Britain's fourth seed Andy Murray play Jarkko Nieminen in the Royal Box at Centre Court. Before and after the match, Murray and Nieminen bowed to the Royal Box, a tradition that had previously not been in use since 2003.
In addition to all the records set during the Isner-Mahut match, the following records were also established:
Novak Djokovic's first-round match against Olivier Rochus was the latest-ever finish at Wimbledon, which finished at 22:58, two minutes before the 23:00 curfew. Djokovic won the match 4–6, 6–2, 3–6, 6–4, 6–2.
Taylor Dent broke the serve speed record at Wimbledon, at 148 mph (beating the record set by Andy Roddick at 146 mph in 2009) in a match against Djokovic. Djokovic won in the end 7–6 (7–5), 6–1, 6–4.
Serena Williams recorded the most aces served by a female at a Grand Slam with 89 aces.
