Ariel "Arik" Benado (Hebrew: אריאל "אריק" בנאדו ‎‎; born December 5, 1973]) is a retired Israeli football defender.
He was a second generation player at Maccabi Haifa; his father, Shlomo, appeared for Haifa in the 1970s. Arik began playing at the age of nine, rising through the ranks to the senior team.

Benado is also a long-standing member of the Israeli national team where he holds the record as the most capped player (94 caps), and plays as a central defender. He is a tough defender, his strength lies in his tackling due to quick foot work. He had successfully defended against top strikers with the club and the national team in Europe.

On June 2010, Benado agreed to return to Maccabi Haifa for one last season before his retirement in June 2011. He started on the bench but quickly became Elisha Levi's first choice in Maccabi Haifa's defense, helping Maccabi Haifa to win the championship.
