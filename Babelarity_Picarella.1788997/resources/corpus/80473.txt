In March 2007, Griffin participated in a charity race at Irwindale Speedway to promote the film Redline, using a Ferrari Enzo owned by Daniel Sadek. During a practice run, Griffin accidentally hit the gas pedal instead of the brake and lost control of the Enzo, crashing hard into a concrete barrier. He walked away unscathed, but the $1.5 million supercar was badly damaged. Griffin later lashed out at reporters who claimed the crash was a publicity stunt.
During the sexual assault allegations on Bill Cosby, Eddie suggested that Cosby was the victim of a conspiracy to destroy his image and that several other prominent African-American men had been victims of similar conspiracies.
