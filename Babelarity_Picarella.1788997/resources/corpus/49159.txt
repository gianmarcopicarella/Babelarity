The dinar was the currency of Sudan between 1992 and 2007. Its ISO 4217 code is "SDD".
The dinar replaced the first Sudanese pound (SDP) on June 8, 1992 at a rate of 1 dinar = 10 pounds. On January 10, 2007, a second Sudanese pound (SDG) was introduced at a rate of 1 pound = 100 dinars. According to the Bank of Sudan, the dinar was to have stopped circulating after a six-month transitional period. The pound and the dinar were to be accepted as legal currency side by side during the six-month period but cheques would be cashed in pounds from the commercial banks. The Bank of Sudan began distributing the new currency to commercial banks and sent consignments of banknotes to the south in 2007. This second Sudanese pound became the only legal tender as of July 1, 2007.
Coins were minted in denominations of ¼, ½, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 dinar (the two smallest denominations appear to have been shelved before being issued). A reduction in size took place, with the 2001-03 coins being generally smaller than the 1994-99 coins. A source indicates that bi-metallic 50 and 100 dinar coins were planned but that this plan was shelved because of the introduction of the second pound. See below for more detail.
Banknotes were issued in denominations of 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000 and 5000 dinars. The lowest three denominations were withdrawn on 1 January 2000 due to a concern that well-used notes could spread disease. Old pound notes also circulated alongside dinar notes.
