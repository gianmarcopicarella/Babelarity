Mercer County is a county located in the U.S. state of Kentucky. As of the 2010 census, the population was 21,331. Its county seat is Harrodsburg. The county was formed from Lincoln County in 1785 and is named for Revolutionary War General Hugh Mercer, who was killed at the Battle of Princeton in 1777.
It is a prohibition or dry county, though Harrodsburg and Pleasant Hill allow the sale of alcohol by the drink. In Kentucky, and perhaps elsewhere, this is referred to as being a "moist" county - wet sells package liquor, wine and beer, dry sells no alcoholic beverages (legally), "moist" serves by the drink, primarily in restaurants. Boyle County (Danville) immediately to the south along US Hwy 127, is fully wet, and has two large liquor outlet stores, plus several smaller, privately owned ones.
Harrodsburg was the first city formally chartered in Kentucky County, the Virginia territory that later became the 15th American state. It was originally the county seat of Lincoln County when it was formed in 1780, but it became the seat of Mercer County when it was created.
Pleasant Hill, also known as Shakertown, is the site of a former Shaker community, active especially during the years before the American Civil War. It is a National Historic Landmark District, consisting of more than 30 historic buildings. The district also includes acres of farm and parkland.
The American Civil War divided the county. The Union Army's 19th Regiment Kentucky Volunteer Infantry was organized at Camp Harwood in Harrodsburg, and was mustered in for a three-year enlistment on January 2, 1862 under the command of Colonel William J. Landram. However, many other county men served in the Confederate Army.
The Louisville Southern Railroad LS network reached Harrodsburg in 1888. Louisville Southern Railway's construction commenced in 1884 and ran from Louisville through Shelbyville and Lawrenceburg to Harrodsburg, which was reached in 1888. The rail yard and station were located at the corner of Office Street and Merimon Avenue. A spur was later constructed from the station to Burgin, where the Louisville Southern joined the Cincinnati Southern's Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific Railway CNO&TP mainline which runs through the eastern part of the country from High Bridge of Kentucky to Burgin to Danville was opened in 1877. Now all run and operated by Norfolk Southern Railway.
