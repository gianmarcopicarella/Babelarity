Carignan is a commune in the Ardennes department in northern France. It is the seat of a canton.
Carignan was, under the name Epoissium, Eposium, Epusum or Ivosium, a military settlement of the Romans. Gaugericus, bishop of Cambrai, was born in Eposium around 550. As Yvois, it was part of the Duchy of Burgundy in the 15th century. It changed hands between the Habsburg Netherlands and France several times, until it was assigned to France by the 1659 Treaty of the Pyrenees. The town was given as a lordship to Prince Eug√®ne-Maurice of Savoy-Carignan, and renamed Carignan in 1662.
