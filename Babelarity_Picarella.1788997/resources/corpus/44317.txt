Los del Río (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈloz ðel ˈri.o], "Those from the River"), also known as The Del Rios, are a Spanish (Andalusian) pop and dance duo which formed in 1962. They are best known for their smash-hit dance single "Macarena", originally released in early 1994. The song went on to become a worldwide success.
The single "Tengo, Tengo" was released on February 18, 1996, and appeared later that year on the album Fiesta Macarena. The group ultimately released six albums: A Mi Me Gusta, Macarena Non Stop, Fiesta Macarena, Colores, Rio y Guestano and Alegria y Cosabuena. Five of the albums featured versions of "Macarena", in different styles and remixes.
Because of their considerable success worldwide, their native town of Dos Hermanas has named a new municipal music hall, the Anfiteatro Los Del Río, after them.
Another well-known song by Los del Rio is "Sevilla Tiene un Color Especial," which is featured prominently in the Spanish smash success movie "Ocho Apellidos Vascos."
