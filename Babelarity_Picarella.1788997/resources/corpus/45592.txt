- On "Black Sheep", Tony Kakko sings different lyrics after the intro. Instead of singing "In love with the maiden, the flower of winter, lowbrow children, in grove of the inland", Tony sings "We're not Iron Maiden, we're not from England, we are Sonata, and we come from Finland." After this, however, Tony sings the lyrics as heard on the Silence album.
- In the middle of "Kingdom for a Heart" they play few lines from "Letter to Dana".
- In "Kingdom for a Heart", Tony changes the line "Treasure and crowns don't mean a thing" to "Treasure and crowns don't mean a shit".
- In the song "Shamandalie", Tony Kakko also changes the line "Time went by" to "Years went by".
- In "Full Moon", Tony changes the lyrics from "Sitting in a corner all alone" to "Standing in a corner all alone", and, at the end of the second verse changes "Mess on the floor again" to "Makes him insane to know".
- During the performance, the band did a medley of some of their other material; however, this was left out of the final cut of the DVD and album, to the disappointment of many fans.
All songs written by T. Kakko, except "Prelude For Reckoning" by Jani Liimatainen
