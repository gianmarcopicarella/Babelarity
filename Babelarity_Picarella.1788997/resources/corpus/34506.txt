The tree is wide at the base and grows to a narrow point towards the top of the tree. Leaves are palmately lobed with up to 5 lobes per leaf. They are 5 to 10 centimeters long and 1.5 to 2.5 centimeters wide and the leaf margin is entire.

The bud opens with the curling back of the outside layer of the flower bud, revealing yellow and red petals with yellowish long stamens. The corolla is 15 to 20 centimeters long and 1.2 to 1.5 centimeters wide. Petals are 10 to 20 centimeters long and 1.2 to 1.5 centimeters wide. The flowers are musty-sweet scented. Flowering period extends from November to February. Flowers are usually pollinated by moths of the Sphingidae family. Fruits are usually ovoid with a markedly thickened peduncle. They contain kidney-shaped, laterally flattened seeds. The seeds have an oil content of 11 percent.
Adansonia za is endemic to Southern and North-Western Madagascar, where it is threatened by habitat loss.
