Earth is a city in Lamb County, West Texas, United States. As of the 2010 Census, the population was 1,065.
Earth was established by William E. Halsell, who laid out the townsite in 1924. Originally Halsell named the city Fairlawn, but in 1925 it was renamed Earth when it was learned that there was already a town in Texas by the name of Fairlawn. In order to find a new name the townspeople sent in suggestions, and the agreed-upon best name was chosen. The name Earth was submitted by Ora Hume (O.H.) Reeves, who became the owner of the city hotel. Mr. Reeves' son-in-law, Frank Wesley Hyatt, was the first postmaster in Earth.
