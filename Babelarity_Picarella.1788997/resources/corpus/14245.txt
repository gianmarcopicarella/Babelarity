Mauro Esposito (born 13 June 1979) is an Italian retired footballer who played mainly as a right winger.
Born in Torre del Greco, Campania, Esposito made his professional debuts in 1997 with Pescara Calcio, going on to play two Serie B campaigns with the team. After an unsuccessful trial with Rangers, he joined Udinese Calcio with which he first appeared in Serie A, playing just nine league games in two years and also being loaned to his previous club.
In 2001–02, Esposito moved to Cagliari Calcio in the second division, being an undisputed starter during his spell with the Sardinians and scoring in double digits in three of his six seasons – in 2003–04, he netted a career-best 17 goals in 40 matches, with his team finishing in second position and returning to the top flight after a five-year absence.
After his scoring partner David Suazo's confirmed departure, on 4 July 2007, A.S. Roma acquired 50% of Esposito's rights for €2 million, plus the free loan of Daniele Magliocchetti. He signed a three-year contract, with a gross annual salary of €1.4 million.
In June 2008, Esposito was purchased definitely by Roma for €350,000, and Magliocchetti was sold in a co-ownership deal for a nominal fee of €484. During his two seasons with the capital side, however, he was very rarely used, with all of his league appearances coming in 2007–08; on 1 September 2008, he was sent on loan to A.C. Chievo Verona in the second division, with the Veneto club having the option to sign him permanently for €2.5M (plus VAT) at the end of the season.
On 1 February 2010, Esposito moved, in the same predicament, to U.S. Grosseto FC, also in the second level. His contract with Roma expired on 30 June and, in September, he signed with Atletico Roma F.C. in Lega Pro Prima Divisione.
In the 2011 summer, his club was dissolved and Esposito retired, aged 32.
On 9 October 2004, Esposito made his debut for Italy, in a 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Slovenia, starting in the 0–1 loss in Celje. He would be later called by coach Marcello Lippi for the pre-World Cup stage held on 2/3 May, but did not make the final cut.
On 16 August 2006, Esposito was picked by new manager Roberto Donadoni for a friendly with Croatia, starting in a 0–2 home defeat. It would be his last appearance for the national team.
