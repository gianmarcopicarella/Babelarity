The two-time defending champion was Justine Henin. She captured her 4th and 3rd consecutive French Open title after defeating Ana Ivanovic of Serbia 6–1, 6–2 in the championship match. This would be Henin's last French open title, and Ivanovic would capture her first grand slam in the French Open the following year.
The tournament was also notable for the first appearances of future World No. 1 and two-time Grand Slam finalist Caroline Wozniacki and future Australian Open champion Angelique Kerber in the main draw of a major event.
