The Korea(n) Bay, sometimes the West Korea(n) Bay (Hangul: 서조선만 or 서한만; hanja: 西朝鮮灣 or 西韓灣; Korean pronunciation: [sʰʌdʑosʰʌn.man] or [sʰʌhan.man]), is a northern extension of the Yellow Sea, between Liaoning Province of China and North P'yŏngan Province of North Korea.
It is separated from the Bohai by the Liaodong Peninsula, with Dalian at its southernmost point.
The Yalu (Amnok) River, which marks the border between China and North Korea, empties into the Korea Bay between Dandong (China) and Sinŭiju (North Korea).
