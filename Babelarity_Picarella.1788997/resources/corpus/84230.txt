The Ecoles Centrales Network is an alliance consisting of the following graduate schools of engineering:
CentraleSupélec (former Ecole Centrale Paris) established in 1829
École centrale de Lille established in 1854
École centrale de Lyon established in 1857
École centrale de Marseille established in 1890
École centrale de Nantes established in 1919
École centrale de Pékin in China, established in 2005.
École centrale de Casablanca in Morocco, established in 2013
Mahindra École Centrale in Hyderabad, India, established in 2014
With about 6,000 graduate engineer students and 800 PhD doctorate students, a total faculty of 700 permanent academic members, 2200 part-time lecturers and associate professors, 450 technical and administrative staff, 2000 researchers, the Ecoles Centrales Network annually approves hundreds of PhD doctorate dissertations and grants 1500 Centrale graduate engineering degrees and other master's degrees. Already more than 35,000 Centrale alumni are active today in business, entrepreneurship, research & development, and management in small and large industries worldwide.
Based on nearly two centuries of recognized Centrale educational know-how in France, the Ecoles Centrales Network's goal is to promote and implement engineering education with the following characteristics, defined as the Centrale Programme:
multidisciplinary curriculum for engineers, with a broad scope of scientific, engineering and management fields taught to all students (civil engineering; mechanical engineering; electrical engineering; information theory & computer science; control science and signal processing; telecom; chemistry, physics and material sciences; micro-nano technologies; manufacturing; safety, logistics; mathematics; economics; statistics, finance; management ...) applicable for French-speaking students with a solid scientific background knowledge and intellectual agility;
first two years for acquisition of a Centrale common body of knowledges, with core and elective thematic flexibility, and at least one year of in-depth thematic studies at the end of the programme ;
close contact with the industry through joint projects and training periods, and requirements for international exposure ;
academic education and applied research closely related to industry stakeholders ;
a unique Centrale graduate diploma in each school.
Education programmes implemented in CentraleSupélec, Lille, Lyon, Marseille and Nantes include
Ingénieur Centralien (Centrale graduate engineering degree)
Masters and PhD doctorate studies
Specialized masters (Mastère MS Spécialisé)
The Centrale Programme (Centrale graduate engineering degree - Grade 300 ECTS) includes a three or four-year curriculum. Application to the Centrale Programme is possible after two/three year undergraduate studies in other educational institutes. Admission to an école centrale requires success in either:
a French nationwide selective exam with numerus clausus : concours Centrale-Supelec, with examination centres located throughout France and in Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia;
an entrance exam for Bachelor of Science : CASTing - Concours d'Admission sur Titre Ingénieur ;
a selection process as per TIME double degrees procedures applicable in Europe ;
a selection process as per TIME Overseas double degree procedures applicable for selected universities in Brasil, Canada, Chile, China, Indonesia, Japan, USA ;
a specific application process for other international students presented by their originating University.
Thus undergraduate studies + the Centralien Programme account for more than a cumulated 300 ECTS credit in the European education system.
Admission to the master's degree programme (workload is either M1+M2 = 120 ECTS or M2 = 60 ECTS) is possible upon application assessment based on academic criteria or is possible as a part of the Centralien Programme. Several master's degrees are available from the different écoles centrales and may be taught in English and/or French, targeting diverse science and engineering domains :
Master's degrees at Centrale Lille
Master's degrees at Centrale Lyon
Master's degrees at Centrale Marseille
Master's degrees at Centrale Nantes
Master's degrees at Centrale Paris
Admission to specialized master's degree programmes (Mastère spécialisé) for master's-level specialization and continuing education in specific engineering and management fields (workload is 75 ECTS) is possible upon application assessment based on candidate profile. MS taught in French include :
MS Centrale Lille
MS Centrale Lyon
MS Centrale Marseille
MS Centrale Nantes
MS Centrale Paris
PhD candidates and visiting researchers should contact directly their preferred labs among 38 different research labs of the Ecoles Centrales.
