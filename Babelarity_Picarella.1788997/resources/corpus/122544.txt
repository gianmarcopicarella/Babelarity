Nu, ぬ in hiragana, or ヌ in katakana, is one of the Japanese kana each representing one mora. Both hiragana and katakana are made in two strokes and represent [nu͍]. They are both derived from the Chinese character 奴. In the Ainu language, katakana ヌ can be written as small ㇴ to represent a final n, and is interchangeable with the standard katakana ン.
