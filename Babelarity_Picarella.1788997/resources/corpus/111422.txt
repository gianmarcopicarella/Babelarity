Charles de La Cerda, commonly known as Charles of Spain (French: Charles d'Espagne) (1327 – 8 January 1354 in L'Aigle), was a Franco-Castilian nobleman and soldier, the son of Alfonso de la Cerda (died 1327) and Isabelle d'Antoing, and grandson of Alfonso de la Cerda (1270–1333). He was a distant cousin of John II of France.
A boyhood companion and favorite of John while he was Duke of Normandy, Charles commanded the Castilian galleys at the Battle of L'Espagnols-sur-Mer, where he was defeated by Edward III of England after a long and desperate struggle. Soon after John's accession as to the throne, he was appointed Constable of France, filling the vacancy left by the execution of Raoul II, Count of Eu, and created Count of Angoulême. Vacant since the death of Joan II of Navarre in 1349, the title to Angoulême was claimed by her son, Charles II, King of Navarre, who bitterly resented La Cerda's preferment. In 1351, Charles de La Cerda married Marguerite, a daughter of Charles, Duke of Brittany.
In 1354, Charles of Navarre and several members of his household set upon and slew de la Cerda in an inn. The repercussions of this murder led to a continuous state of instability within France that was only resolved when Charles, duke of Normandy became king in 1364.
