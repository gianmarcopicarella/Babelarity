The Who have been with several labels over the years. In the United Kingdom and elsewhere outside North America, they were signed originally to Brunswick Records. In 1966, they moved to Polydor Records and took the rights to their Brunswick recordings with them. They created and moved to Track Records the following year with distribution by Polydor. They left Track in 1974 and returned to Polydor directly, remaining with the label ever since.
In North America, they were originally on Decca Records. They moved to Atco Records for one single in 1966 before returning to Decca later that year. In 1972 the US Decca label was absorbed into MCA Records. The band changed North American labels again in 1981, to Warner Bros. Records. The label released Face Dances and It's Hard and their singles, before The Who disbanded. In later years, MCA would acquire the US rights to the WBR albums. In 2003, MCA Records (now under common ownership with Polydor, under Universal Music Group) was folded into Geffen Records - which, ironically, was originally an independent label distributed by WBR. Geffen now controls the US rights to The Who's catalogue up through It's Hard. Their 2006 comeback album, Endless Wire, was released through Universal Republic in the US.
