The 1979 Argentine Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 21 January 1979 at the Aut√≥dromo Municipal Ciudad de Buenos Aires.
Lap Leaders: Patrick Depailler 10 laps (1-10); Jacques Laffite 43 laps (11-53).
The race had to be restarted because there was a huge crash at the second of the very fast esses after the pit straight that took off a number of drivers, including Jody Scheckter, Nelson Piquet, John Watson, Patrick Tambay and Mario Andretti.
Formula One debut for Elio de Angelis.
Local hero Carlos Reutemann charged through the field up from 6th to 2nd, although it wasn't enough to catch Jacques Laffite.
Note: Only the top five positions are included for both sets of standings.
