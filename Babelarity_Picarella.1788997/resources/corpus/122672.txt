The grapheme Ň (minuscule: ň) is a letter in the Czech, Slovak and Turkmen alphabets. It is formed from Latin N with the addition of a caron (háček in Czech and mäkčeň in Slovak) and follows plain N in the alphabet. Ň and ň are at Unicode codepoints U+0147 and U+0148, respectively.
In Czech and Slovak, ň represents /ɲ/, the palatal nasal. Thus, it has the same function as Croatian nj, Polish ń, Spanish ñ, Portuguese nh and French gn.
In the nineteenth century it was used in Croatian, also, to denote /ɲ/.
In Turkmen and Southern Kurdish, ň represents the sound /ŋ/, the velar nasal, as in English thing.
