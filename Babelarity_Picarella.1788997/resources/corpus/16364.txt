Rosset turned professional in 1988 and won his first tour singles title in 1989 Geneva as a wildcard, defeating Guillermo Pérez Roldán. His first doubles title was also won in Geneva in 1991 partnering Sergi Bruguera.
1992 was the pinnacle of Rosset's career. Representing Switzerland at the Olympic Games in Barcelona, he defeated several big-name players en route to qualifying for the men's singles final, including Jim Courier, Goran Ivanišević, Wayne Ferreira, and Emilio Sánchez. In the final, he faced Spain's Jordi Arrese and won an exciting five-set match, 7–6, 6–4, 3–6, 4–6, 8–6, to claim the Gold Medal. Rosset also won the 1992 French Open men's doubles title partnering Jakob Hlasek. Rosset was also a member of the Swiss team which reached the final of the 1992 Davis Cup. Switzerland lost in the final to the United States, despite Rosset's winning a five-set singles rubber against Jim Courier (who was ranked the World No. 1 at the time).
Rosset's most memorable Davis Cup match came in defeat in a singles rubber against Arnaud Clément of France in 2001, which he lost 15–13 in the fifth set after 5 hours and 46 minutes. During the later years of his playing career, Rosset also served as the Swiss Davis Cup team captain.
Rosset also enjoyed success playing in other international team competitions for Switzerland. In 1996, he was a member of the teams which won the World Team Cup and finished runners-up in the Hopman Cup. That year he also achieved his best performance at a Grand Slam when he beat Carl-Uwe Steeb, Jiří Novák, Jakob Hlasek, Stefan Edberg and Bernd Karbacher before losing to Michael Stich in the semi finals.
Rosset had a 2–2 record against his successor as Switzerland's top male tennis player, Roger Federer. Rosset won their first two meetings in 2000 (including the final of the Open 13 at Marseille), but Federer won their meetings in 2001 and 2003.
At 2.01 metres (6 ft. 7 in.) Rosset was one of the game's tallest players throughout his career. He had a reputation for being one of the most powerful servers in tennis. He was one of the game's fastest servers and most prolific servers of aces for most of his career.
Rosset changed his flight plans after a first-round defeat at the US Open in September 1998. After he changed his plans, the flight he had originally planned to take, Swissair Flight 111, crashed in the Atlantic Ocean, killing all on board.
Rosset's career-high ATP singles ranking was World No. 9, and his career-high doubles ranking was World No. 8. He won a total of 15 top-level singles titles and 8 doubles titles. He won at least one singles title on all surfaces: clay, grass, carpet, and hard court. His career prize money totaled $6,812,693.
