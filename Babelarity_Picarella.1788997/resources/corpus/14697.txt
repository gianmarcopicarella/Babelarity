This page was accurate before, but now someone have put a lot of wrong information and it's not useful anymore. There are 5 missing AA titles of Italy, also missing AA titles of Bulgaria and Russia is put instead. There is no clean division between Individual and Group titles like before, the names of the gymnasts with AA titles are removed and the total number of medals increased with more than 100 from Stuttgart, which is practically impossible.
The World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships are the World Championships for the sport of rhythmic gymnastics. They were first held in 1963. Only the Soviet Union (Post-Soviet Republics of today), Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia and East Germany have won individual all-around medals at the World Championships, except for 1975 which they boycotted. On the other hand, groups are more open than individuals â€“ Eastern and Southern Europe are the duumvirate of the group competitions.
