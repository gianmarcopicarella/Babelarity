Jean-Gaston Darboux FAS MIF FRS FRSE (14 August 1842 – 23 February 1917) was a French mathematician.
He was born in Nimes in France on 13 August 1842. He studied at the Nimes Lycee and the Montpellier Lycee before being accepted at the Sorbonne.
Darboux made several important contributions to geometry and mathematical analysis (see, for example, linear PDEs). He was a biographer of Henri Poincaré and he edited the Selected Works of Joseph Fourier.
Darboux received his Ph.D. from the École Normale Supérieure in 1866. His thesis, written under the direction of Michel Chasles, was titled Sur les surfaces orthogonales. In 1884, Darboux was elected to the Académie des Sciences. In 1900, he was appointed the Academy's permanent secretary of its Mathematics section.
Among his students were Émile Borel, Élie Cartan, Gheorghe Țițeica and Stanisław Zaremba.
Darboux's contribution to the differential geometry of surfaces appears in the four-volume collection of studies he published between 1887 and 1896; see links below for access to these texts.
In 1902, he was elected to the Royal Society; in 1916, he received the Sylvester Medal from the Society.
He was a plenary speaker in the International Congress of Mathematicians 1908, Rome.
