Pieter Weening (born 5 April 1981) is a road bicycle racer from Harkema, Friesland, the Netherlands, currently riding for Roompot–Oranje Peloton. From 2004 to 2011, he rode for Rabobank. In August 2015, it was announced that Weening had signed for Team Roompot for the 2016 season.
In 2005 Weening won a stage in the Tour de France. After one of the closest finishes in the Tour ever, Weening won the eighth stage just ahead of Andreas Klöden. In the same year he also won a stage in the Tour de Pologne and finished second overall, five seconds behind winner Kim Kirchen. He was named Dutch cyclist of 2005.
With only a stage win in the Tour of Austria, Weening had to wait six years before a next big victory. In the 2011 Giro d'Italia, just one day after the neutralised stage due to the death of Wouter Weylandt, Weening won stage 5. Analysts described this stage as a 'Mini Tour of Lombardy'. The stage had an uphill finish and several unpaved stretches (strade bianche). Weening was the strongest on the uphill finish of a small break away and stayed just in front of the peloton. After the stage win, he was awarded the Pink leaders jersey. He gave the physical jersey awarded to him on the podium to Wouter Weylandt's family.
On 10 August 2011, and after eight seasons with Rabobank, Weening left the team to join the new GreenEDGE squad for its inaugural season in 2012.
In 2013, Weening won the Tour de Pologne after starting the time trial fifth overall, and 27 seconds down. He managed to take the lead by placing a solid performance.
In 2014, Weening again won a stage in the Giro d'Italia, after also being part of the team that won the first-stage team time trial. On stage 10, he took part in the day's main breakaway and, along with Davide Malacarne (Team Europcar), was able to stay away to the end of the stage. He outsprinted Malacarne in the closing metres, to take the third individual stage win of his career. Weening also won the 2014 Giro della Toscana from a solo attack.
