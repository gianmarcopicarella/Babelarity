Loch Tay (Scottish Gaelic, Loch Tatha) is a freshwater loch in the central highlands of Scotland, in the Perth and Kinross and Stirling council areas.
It is a long narrow loch of around 14.55 mi (23.42 km) long, and typically around 1 to 1Â½ miles wide, following the line of the valley from the south west to north east. It is the sixth largest loch in Scotland by area and over 150 m (490 ft) deep at its deepest.
Ben Lawers on its north shore is at 1214 m the 10th highest mountain in the British Isles, and is the highest peak in a group of seven munros.
Killin at the head of the loch, and Kenmore at the outflow of the River Tay, are the main settlements on the lochside today. The smaller settlements of Acharn, Ardeonaig and Ardtalnaig are located on the south side of the loch whilst Fearnan and Lawers are on the north side. The loch is fed by the rivers Dochart and Lochay at its head and numerous smaller streams.
The loch is a popular spot for salmon fishing.
The loch, and many of its surroundings, feature in the traditional Scottish 'Loch Tay Boat Song' (Scottish Gaelic, Iorram Loch Tatha).
Loch Tay railway station was on the Killin Railway. It is now closed.
In ancient times (in the Iron Age) people lived on defensible, man-made islands on the loch, called crannogs. More than 20 submerged crannogs have been identified in the loch. An example has now been reconstructed on the south side of the loch at the Scottish Crannog Centre.
