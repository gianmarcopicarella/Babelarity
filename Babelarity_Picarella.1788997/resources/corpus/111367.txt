Prince Felix of Denmark, Count of Monpezat (Felix Henrik Valdemar Christian; born 22 July 2002), is the younger son of Prince Joachim and his former wife, Alexandra, Countess of Frederiksborg.
As of July 2016, Felix is eighth in the line of succession to the Danish throne.
Prince Felix was born at Rigshospitalet (Copenhagen University Hospital) on 22 July 2002. When his father met the press following the birth, he joked that the baby could be named anything from Ib to Nebukadnesar.
He was christened in Møgeltønder Church in Møgeltønder on 4 October 2002 by the royal vicar Christian Thodberg. His names were revealed to be Felix Henrik Valdemar Christian. His godparents are Martina Bent (maternal aunt); and friends of his parents: Count Christian Ahlefeldt-Laurvig, Oscar Davidsen Siesbye, Damian Sibley and Annick Boel. At the christening the musical work Dåbens Pagt composed by Frederik Magle, dedicated to Prince Felix, was given its first performance.
In addition, the prince is of Chinese descent, as his mother is a great-granddaughter of Mary Ho Li from Guangdong, China. 
After their divorce, Prince Joachim and Alexandra have joint custody of Prince Felix and his older brother Prince Nikolai. Felix attended pre-school at the Garnison Church in Copenhagen, and at age six, followed in the footsteps of his father, brother and uncle at Krebs School in Østerbro.
Felix is styled as "His Highness Prince Felix of Denmark, Count of Monpezat". He has been Prince of Denmark since birth and Count of Monpezat since 29 April 2008, when Queen Margrethe granted the title to her male-line descendants.
