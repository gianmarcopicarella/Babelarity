Ricardo Enrique Bochini (born 25 January 1954 in Zárate, Buenos Aires) is an Argentine former professional footballer, who played as an attacking midfielder. He is nicknamed El Bocha. He spent his almost twenty years of his professional career at Argentine club Independiente, becoming one of the most emblematic players in the history of the club.
Playing for Independiente, Bochini won eight international titles, four Argentine championships, and the 1986 FIFA World Cup with the Argentina national football team. Bochini was a childhood idol of Diego Maradona.
As a kid, Bochini was wanted by Campana's club Villa Dálmine but started playing football for Belgrano, a local club from his home city. At age of 15, he went to Buenos Aires with his father to try to join San Lorenzo de Almagro and later with Boca Juniors. He was eventually accepted for the youth system of Independiente in 1971. He made his professional debut in the Argentine Primera División on 25 June 1972, when Independiente's coach, Pedro Dellacha sent him onto the field in the 74th minute of a match that they lost 1–0 to River Plate. 
By that time Independiente had already won the 1972 Copa Libertadores, which allowed them to play the Intercontinental Cup that same year but Bochini was not part of the team that lost the tie to Ajax. He gained more participation the following year and was an important member of the team, alongside Daniel Bertoni. The team won the 1973 Copa Libertadores and the 1973 Intercontinental Cup. Bochini scored the only goal in the latter against Juventus.
The club managed to defend the Copa Libertadores title in 1974. São Paulo had won the first match of the final at Pacaembu stadium and Independiente the second one at their stadium (Bochini scored the first goal). The final had to go on a third match at the national stadium of Chile, where Ricardo Pavoni scored the only goal.
Independiente was to play the Intercontinental Cup in 1974 and 1975 against Bayern Munich but they declined both times. Atlético de Madrid, the 1973–74 European Cup's runners-up, played instead of them in 1974 and won the title. The Intercontinental Cup was not held in 1975.
In 1975 Bochini was conscripted into Military service and managed to also play football, but was not able to perform as well as desired. Nevertheless, he also won the 1975 Copa Libertadores with Independiente. It was Bochini's third title in a row and the club's fourth, being the only club to achieve this so far.
Bochini was also part of the team that won the Copa Interamericana in 1974 and 1975 against Municipal and Atlético Español respectively.
After finishing in the second position of the Metropolitano Championship in 1977, Bochini won his first national championship with Independiente that same year. Bochini scored the last goal in the final against Talleres de Córdoba that gave them the title.
Bochini repeated the title with Independiente in 1978 winning the final against River Plate. After four years without any title, Independiente signed Jorge Burruchaga and José Percudani, who formed a celebrated offense with Bochini that helped the team win the 1983 Metropolitano Championship, the 1984 Copa Libertadores and the 1984 Intercontinental Cup against Liverpool.
At the end of his career Bochini won the 1988–89 Argentine Primera División being this his last title.
On 5 May 1991 Bochini played his last professional match against Estudiantes de La Plata. He played a total of 634 league matches, scoring 97 goals. He is the player with the most appearances in the Argentine Primera División after goalkeeper Hugo Gatti, who played in 775 league matches.
Argentine coach César Menotti had selected Bochini several times in the 70's, but eventually he lost his place to Norberto Alonso for the 1978 FIFA World Cup.
Bochini played again in the national team when Carlos Bilardo succeeded Menotti as coach, but lost his place to younger players such as Diego Maradona. Nevertheless, he was part of the squad that won the 1986 FIFA World Cup but played only a few minutes in the semi-finals against Belgium replacing Jorge Burruchaga.
Although he was not a prolific goalscorer, he was one of the best playmakers of the 1980s, often making assists for teammates to score. Even after he retired, the expression pase bochinesco ("bochinesque pass") is used to refer to a precise pass made to a forward to leave him one on one against the goalie, bypassing the opponent's defenders. Bochini became a master of la pausa, the moment when a number 10, poised to deliver a pass, delays a fraction, waiting for the player he is looking to feed to reach the ideal position.
In 1991, three months after his retirement, Bochini was assigned as Independiente's manager together with Carlos Fren. The couple coached only the 1991 Apertura tournament that the team ended in the eleventh position.
Fifth division club Barracas Bolívar decided to include him to play a few minutes in an official match played on 27 February 2007, 16 years after his retirement, as a recognition to his career.
On November 2007 a street was named after him in the city of Avellaneda where Independiente's Stadium is located.
Bochini played for Independiente's veteran team in an official tournament organized by the Argentine Football Association in 2009.
He currently works as football advisor and image representative for Independiente
