TBS is notoriously known for intentionally violating protection of sources in October 1989. In that month of that year, the Tokyo Broadcasting System taped an interview with Tsutsumi Sakamoto regarding his efforts to unveil the deceptive dogmas of the Japanese Aum Shinrikyo sect. However, the network secretly showed a video of the interview to Aum members without Sakamoto's knowledge, intentionally breaking its protection of sources. Aum officials then pressured TBS to cancel the planned broadcast of the interview, but Sakamoto was murdered by the members after a few days, on the 3rd of November. This makes TBS indirectly responsible for a homicide of a person who combated the dangerous sect and attempted to bring the attention of the public to the everyday human rights violations taking place within that sect.
