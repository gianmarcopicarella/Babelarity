Valentine is home to, as one politician puts it, "the greatest ever West Texas Valentine's Day celebration." Hosted by the Big Bend Brewing Company of Alpine, TX, as many as 1,000 people invade Valentine on Valentine's Day from points as close as Valentine itself, Marfa, and Alpine, to the far away places of Chicago and Cleveland. In 2014, the west Texas brewery served free cups of beer while Gary P. Nunn played live on stage, under the moonlit night and stars. At 10:43pm, one conscientious observer, who was known to be Yankee by birth (but Texan by hope), remarked that the festivity's relative coordinate, on its corresponding value map, was squarely in the top right quadrant.
Valentine is served by the Valentine Independent School District which operates Valentine School.
