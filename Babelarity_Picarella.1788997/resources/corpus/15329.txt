Le coq sportif (French pronunciation: ​[lə kɔk spɔʁtif], "The Athletic Rooster") is a French company producing sports equipment such as shoes, shorts, and T-shirts. It was founded in 1882 by Émile Camuset, but the first clothing items branded with the rooster appeared in 1948. The company's name derives from the Gallic rooster, a national symbol of France.
The company has sponsorship deals with several football clubs, most notably Everton F.C. In addition, the company also sponsors the Quick Step-Innergetic and Team Milram cycling teams. Le coq sportif also supplied kits to the Tottenham Hotspur team that won the FA Cup in 1981 and 1982, Aston Villa 1982 team that won the European Cup, Chelsea, Sunderland, Sheffield United and Everton and Ajax Amsterdam of the mid-1980s; the FIFA World Cup winning teams of Italy in 1982 and Argentina in 1986. The company also sponsored Brazilian Club SC Internacional in 1982. The club won the traditional Joan Gamper trophy at the Camp Nou in Barcelona while using Le Coq uniforms. Internacional also won the Gaúcho Championship in 82 wearing Le Coq.
South Korean golfer Yang Yong-eun wore a Le Coq Sportif shirt on the last day of the PGA Championship in 2009, which he won. It also has an endorsement deal with NBA basketball player Joakim Noah.
Le Coq Sportif is famous in Japan and Korea and hired local designers to complete and adapt the global collection for local market. They also signed some partnerships to release special models. Le Coq Sportif in Japan associated with Sou to create handmade shoes and tabi. They also released a line of shoes with designer Kamishima Chinami. For Le Coq Sportif Korea, the partnership was made with the car manufacturer Peugeot to create a shoe named the "Peugeot 207cc." The shoes were recalled in 2009 for a product fault, when the fabric was exposed to water the shoe's stitching would come apart. This in turn lost Le Coq Sportif millions in revenue.
In 2012, Le Coq Sportif returned to professional cycling, and manufactured the jerseys for the Tour de France under a new five-year contract with Amaury Sport Organisation. Le Coq Sportif started supplying the Tour de France in 1951.
