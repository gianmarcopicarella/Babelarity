Gavril Radomir (Bulgarian: Гаврил Радомир, Greek: Γαβριὴλ Ρωμανός/Gavriil Romanos, anglicized as "Gabriel Radomir") was the emperor (tsar) of Bulgaria from October 1014 to August or September 1015. He was the son of tsar Samuel (r. 997–1014). During his father's reign, his cousin Ivan Vladislav and Ivan's entire family were all sentenced by Samuel to death for treason. Gavril's intervention saved them. He is said to have saved his father's life in the disastrous defeat of the Battle of Spercheios, and he was described as a gallant fighter.
Around the same time that Emperor Basil II captured the bulk of Samuel's army, Gavril and his forces defeated the army of Theophylact Botaneiates. Having inherited Samuel's war with the Byzantine Empire, Gavril Radomir raided Byzantine territory, reaching as far as Constantinople. However, the Byzantines secured the assistance of Ivan Vladislav, who owed his life to Radomir. Vladislav murdered Radomir while hunting near Ostrovo, and then took the throne for himself.
Some sources connect Gavril Radomir with the medieval dualist sect, Bogomilism, a popular heretic movement that flourished in the region of Macedonia during his and his father's reign.
Gavril Radomir married twice. His son Peter (II) Delyan played a role in attempting to secure independence for Bulgaria several decades later.
