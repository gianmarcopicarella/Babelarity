Not to be confused with Martin Vasquez.
Rafael Martín Vázquez (born 25 September 1965) is a Spanish retired footballer who played mostly as an attacking midfielder, with above-average skills.
He represented most notably Real Madrid, having represented it in two different spells, amassing La Liga totals of 252 games and 42 goals for the club, but also played abroad in Italy, France, Mexico and Germany.
Martín Vázquez appeared for Spain in one World Cup and one European Championship, gaining nearly 40 caps.
Born in Madrid, Martín Vázquez joined the youth teams of Real Madrid in 1980 at the age of 15 and made his debuts for the first team three years later, going on to achieve fame as part of the Quinta del Buitre which still included Míchel, Emilio Butragueño, Miguel Pardeza and Manolo Sanchís. In 1989–90, as Real achieved a club and La Liga record of 107 goals, he scored a career-best 14, second only in the team to Hugo Sánchez's 38 successful strikes.
After the arrival of Romanian Gheorghe Hagi, Martín Vázquez decided to accept the offer of Torino FC, but failed to settle in Italy during his two-season spell (although he did help the team reach the 1992 UEFA Cup Final). He then moved to Olympique de Marseille but only lasted two months in France, after which a return to Real Madrid was arranged; in his two stints with the Merengues, he won six leagues, two UEFA Cups and two King's Cups.
As injuries hit him, Martín Vázquez eventually retired from football at the end of 1998, after unassuming spells with Deportivo de La Coruña, Club Celaya (where he teamed up with Butragueño) and Karlsruher SC (German second division). Afterwards he worked with Real Madrid as a youth coach, while also keeping fit with the club's veteran team.
Martín Vázquez played 38 times for Spain, including at UEFA Euro 1988 and the 1990 FIFA World Cup. His debut came on 23 September 1987 in a friendly match with Luxembourg.
