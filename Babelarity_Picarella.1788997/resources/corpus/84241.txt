The University of Tampere (UTA) (Finnish: Tampereen yliopisto) is a university in Tampere, Finland. It has 15,400 degree students and 2,100 employees. It was originally founded in 1925 in Helsinki as a "Civic College" (Kansalaiskorkeakoulu), and from 1930 onwards it was known as a "School of Social Sciences" (Yhteiskunnallinen korkeakoulu). In 1960, the institution relocated to Tampere, and in 1966 it was officially named University of Tampere.
The University of Tampere began in 1925 in Helsinki as an institution generally referred to as a Civic College. The guiding notion was that enlightenment was conducive to peaceful societal development. It was felt that large sectors of the population and especially young people in the rural areas were in need of enhanced popular education.
In the early years of its operations interest in the Civic College focussed increasingly on catering for the educational needs of the municipal administration and press. The major success areas, a qualification in social care and a qualification in librarianship, came into being in the 1940s.
In 1960 the institution moved to Tampere and within years the student intake increased fivefold and the former specialised college expanded into a multi-faculty university. The name was changed to the University of Tampere in 1966.
The university is currently divided into nine schools:
Institute of Biomedical Technology
School of Communication, Media and Theatre
School of Education
School of Health Sciences
School of Humanities and Social Sciences
School of Information sciences
School of Language, Translation Studies and Literary Studies
School of Medicine
School of Management
The University collaborates with the City of Tampere, Tampere Region and other higher education institutes in the area, likewise with companies and public sector organisations.
