Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights is a 1992 feature film adaptation of Emily Brontë's novel Wuthering Heights directed by Peter Kosminsky.
Paramount Pictures was forced to use the author's name in the title of the film as Samuel Goldwyn Studio (later sold to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer) owned the rights to the simple title Wuthering Heights due to the copyright on their 1939 film version of the novel. The film stars Ralph Fiennes as the tortured Heathcliff and Juliette Binoche as the free-spirited Catherine Earnshaw, in a precursor to their later, successful collaboration on The English Patient. The role of Heathcliff opened up doors for Ralph Fiennes to play Amon Goeth in Schindler's List. American director Steven Spielberg claimed he liked Fiennes for Goeth because of his "dark sexuality."
This particular film is notable for including the oft-omitted second generation story of the children of Cathy, Hindley and Heathcliff.
Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights, released in 1992, is based on the 1847 book by Emily Brontë which was written a year before her death. It is her first and only prose novel. The movie revolves around the lives of the Earnshaws and the Lintons. It portrays the role of suffering, revenge and unrequited love in society.
