Maria Anna Amalia of Courland (12 June 1653, Mitau – 16 June 1711, Weilmünster) was a German noblewoman. A princess of Courland from the Ketteler family, she was also Landgravine of Hesse-Kassel via her marriage on 21 May 1673 to her first cousin Charles I, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel. She was the child of Jacob Kettler and Margravine Louise Charlotte of Brandenburg, eldest daughter of George William, Elector of Brandenburg.
Amalia was a daughter of the Duke Jacob of Courland (1610–1662) from his marriage to Louise Charlotte (1617–1676), eldest daughter of the Elector George William of Brandenburg.
On 21 May 1673, she married in Kassel her first cousin Landgrave Charles I of Hesse-Kassel (1654–1730). Amalia had previously been engaged with Charles older brother, William VII, but he died during his grand tour at the young age of 19 years.
The Landgravine participated in the creation of Karlsaue Park in Kassel. The marmor fountain in the park contains a medallion by the influential Roman sculptor Pierre Etienne Monnot (1657–1733) depicting Maria Amalia.
She was described as modest, affable and pious.
