Oryx Douala qualified for the inaugural Cup of Champions Clubs after winning the domestic league the previous season. Douala were then placed in the "Central Africa" group and after topping this group, progressed to the semi-finals, where they played Real Republicans of Ghana. A 2–1 victory put Douala in the final, and a 2–1 win in front of a crowd of 30,000 at Accra Stadium saw Oryx Douala crowned champions of Africa. However, the club have been unable to emulate this success since, with a semi-finals appearance two years being the closest they have come.
