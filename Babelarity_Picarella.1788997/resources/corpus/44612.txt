Luis Miguel Gallego Basteri (April 19, 1970), known professionally as Luis Miguel, is a Mexican singer and an icon in Latin America, he is often referred to as El Sol de México. He is one of the most successful artists in Latin American history, having successfully performed in a wide range of musical styles, including pop, ballads, boleros and mariachi. To date, he has sold over 100 million records worldwide.
Latin pop music, along with his personal life and showmanship on stage, has made Luis Miguel an icon for nearly his entire career, which started in Mexico in 1981. Having won his first Grammy Award at the age of fourteen for his duet "Me Gustas Tal Como Eres" with Sheena Easton, he is the third youngest act in music history to receive this accolade. In 1991, the RIAA recognized the high sales for his 1991 album Romance, itself being the third best-selling music album in Mexico, and one of the best-selling Spanish language albums of all time. He was the first Latin artist to have been awarded two Platinum certified Spanish-language albums in the United States (Romance and Segundo Romance). His most recent album, Luis Miguel, was released in 2010 and achieved gold and platinum certifications in four countries within three days of its release.
He is also known for his high-grossing live performances. He is an annual headliner in The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, and he has sold-out the National Auditorium in Mexico City over 230 times in over twenty years. With the Luis Miguel Tour, his most recent concert tour, he visited 22 countries in North America, South America and Europe. Having performed in a three-and-a-half-year span a total of 223 shows all over the world, this tour is the longest and highest-grossing tour ever made by a Latin American artist.
During his child years, his father Luisito Rey, who was also his manager, encouraged him to watch and analyze nearly every movie, recording, and concert performance of Elvis Presley.
In 1982, at the age of 12, Luis Miguel released his first album, Un Sol, by the Mexican branch of EMI Records. Two years later, he started touring Latin American countries including Colombia, Venezuela, Chile, his native Puerto Rico and Argentina. He scored a major hit with his single, "1+1=Dos Enamorados".
