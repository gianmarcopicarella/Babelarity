Mascali (Sicilian: MÃ scali) is a comune (municipality) in the Province of Catania in the Italian region Sicily, located about 170 kilometres (110 mi) east of Palermo and about 30 kilometres (19 mi) northeast of Catania.
The town of Mascali was entirely rebuilt after its almost complete destruction by lava from the nearby Etna in 1928.
