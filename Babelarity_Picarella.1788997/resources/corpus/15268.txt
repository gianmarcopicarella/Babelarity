Serena Williams was the defending champion, but lost to Sabine Lisicki in the fourth round. This was the fourth time in a row that Lisicki defeated the reigning French Open champion at Wimbledon; Svetlana Kuznetsova in 2009, Li Na in 2011, Maria Sharapova in 2012, and Williams in 2013 (Lisicki did not play in 2010).
The exits of Li Na and Petra Kvitová in the quarterfinals ensured that the eventual tournament victor would be a first-time Grand Slam winner. Sabine Lisicki was the first German finalist in a Grand Slam since Steffi Graf at the 1999 Wimbledon Championships (lost to Lindsay Davenport), while Marion Bartoli was the first French female player to appear in a major final since her own 2007 Wimbledon final (lost to Venus Williams).
Bartoli won in the final in straight sets to claim her first Wimbledon title, the first French major champion since Amélie Mauresmo in 2006. She won the Championships without dropping a set. By winning a Grand Slam title in her 47th appearance, she broke the previous women's record of 45, set by Jana Novotná in 1998, for most appearances in a Grand Slam tournament before winning. This was later broken itself by Flavia Pennetta, who won the 2015 US Open on her 49th appearance.
