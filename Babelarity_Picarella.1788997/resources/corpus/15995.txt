Adrien Tambay (born 25 February 1991) is a French professional racing driver at Audi. He is the son of former Formula One driver Patrick Tambay, who won two Grands Prix for Ferrari in the early 1980s.
Born in Paris, Tambay began his car racing career in the German Formula BMW ADAC series, finishing fourth. He moved to the new Formula BMW Europe series in 2008, where he finished third behind Esteban Gutiérrez and Marco Wittmann.
In 2009 he raced in the Formula Three Euroseries for leading team ART Grand Prix. He missed the Oschersleben and Nürburgring rounds of the Euroseries, and also an invitational entry to the British Formula 3 Championship at Spa, due to a head injury suffered playing football. He ended the Euroseries season pointless, recording a best finish of seventh at EuroSpeedway and the Norisring.
In 2010 he raced in the Auto GP series for Charouz-Gravity Racing 
After James Jakes had a wrist injury at Hockenheim, Tambay was called in to replace him in Manor Racing. In his second outing at Spa-Francorchamps, Tambay retired first race and therefore started 27th in the second race. The rain started during the race, but Tambay kept driving on slicks, and winning the race ahead of Alexander Rossi.
Adrien Tambay is driving one of eight Audi A5 DTM cars in the 2012 DTM championship.
