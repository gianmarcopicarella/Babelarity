1992 Galvarino, provisional designation 1968 OD, is a stony asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt, about 10 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Chilean astronomers Carlos Torres and S. Cofre at the National Astronomical Observatory's Cerro El Roble Station on 18 July 1968.
The S-type asteroid is a member of the Eos family, an orbital group of more than 4,000 asteroids, which are well known for mostly being of stony composition with a relatively high albedo. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.8–3.1 AU once every 5 years and 2 months (1,892 days). Its orbit shows a low eccentricity of 0.05 and is tilted by 11 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. It has a rotation period of 7 hours and an albedo of about 0.14, based on the surveys carried out by the WISE satellite and its subsequent NEOWISE mission.
The asteroid was named after the Mapuche warrior Galvarino, the heroic figure during the Arauco War, a long-running conflict between colonial Spaniards and the Mapuche people of the 16th century in what is now Chile. He was condemned by the Spanish soldiers to have his hands cut off and then to be freed as a living lesson to other Indians. Since his request for death was not granted, he promised revenge. He continued to fight the conquerors until recaptured and condemned to the gallows.
