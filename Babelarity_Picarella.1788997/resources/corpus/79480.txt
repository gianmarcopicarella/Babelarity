Med school student Teddy Grey (Milo Ventimiglia) graduates top of his class from Harvard and joins one of the nation’s most prestigious pathology programs. There, a rivalry develops between a group of interns and Teddy. They invite him into their group, which entertains itself with a secret after-hours game at the morgue of who can commit the perfect undetectable murder. Eventually the group's leader, Jake Gallo, realizes that Teddy is sleeping with his girlfriend, Dr. Juliette Bath. When Teddy catches several members of the group in lies, he realizes that what initially seemed like vigilante killings are, in actuality, just innocent people murdered for sport.
Teddy's fiancée Gwen arrives to stay with him in his apartment. Gallo, angered by Juliette's infidelity, kills her for the next game. However, just as they are about to begin the autopsy on Bath (in the meantime plotting Teddy's death), Gallo realizes that the gas has been left on in the room, resulting in a massive explosion as one of the group lights a meth pipe, killing everyone but Teddy who was not in the room. Gallo realizes what is about to happen and survives. Teddy is seen walking away from the explosion.
Later, Gallo manages to kill Gwen in what he believes to be the "perfect murder". Upon completing his autopsy report on his murdered fiancée, Teddy is knocked out by Gallo and then is forced to trade verbal barbs with him. Teddy uses some of Gallo's own rhetoric against him in reverse psychology fashion, after which fellow pathologist Ben Stravinsky frees Teddy and together they kill Gallo in exactly the same way that he killed Teddy's fiancée. In the process, they commence dissecting a still alive Gallo.
