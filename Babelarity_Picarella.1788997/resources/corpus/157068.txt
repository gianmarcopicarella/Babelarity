Garoua (German: Garua) is a port city and the capital of the North Region of Cameroon, lying on the Benue River. It is the center of trade of the surrounding agricultural region and also houses several textile processing facilities. The city has 235,996 inhabitants according to the 2005 Census, making it the third most populous city in Cameroon after the seaport city of Douala and the capital, Yaoundé.
Garoua is an oasis of green in the heart of the bush. It therefore constitutes a tourist hub: to the north lie the Waza National Park and the Kapsiki region, and to the south the Benue National Park, the Bouba Njida National Park, and the Faro Reserve. The city is the birthplace of the first President of Cameroon Ahmadou Ahidjo. Because of this it has benefited from many developments, including an international airport with direct flights to Paris via Cameroon Airlines. The major and dominant ethnic group in the town are the Fulbe.
The average temperature in Garoua ranges from 26.0 °C (78.8 °F) in the January to 33.0 °C (91.4 °F) in April.
