Jayavarman I (Khmer: ជ័យវរ្ម័នទី១), is considered to be the last ruler of a united Chenla Kingdom, the predecessor polity of the Khmer Empire.
He ruled from approximately 657 until after 690. Over the course of his reign, and that of his predecessors Bhavavarman II and Candravarman, the Khmer kings power was consolidated in the areas previously controlled by the Funan culture. However, Jayavarman left no male heirs, which led to the division of Cambodia.
Inscriptions associated with his reign are found at Tuol Kok Prah, Wat Prei Val, Prah Kuha Luon, Wat Kdei Ang, Wat Baray, and Tuol Nak Ta Bak Ka. His palace was located at Purandarapura. He was the great-grandson of Isanavarman I. Jayavarman I's daughter, Queen Jayadevi, succeeded him as queen.
Jayavarman II - considered by most to be the first king of the Khmer Angkor kingdom, ruling at the beginning of the 9th century.
