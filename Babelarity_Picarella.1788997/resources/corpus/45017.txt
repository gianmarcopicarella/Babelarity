The Reminder is the third full-length album by indie artist Feist. It was released on April 23, 2007 in countries outside of North America, and May 1, 2007 in the United States and Canada.
Following its release, it debuted on the U.S. Billboard 200 at number 16, selling about 31,000 copies in its first week, and debuted at number 2 in Canada, selling just over 18,000 copies. As of July 25, 2011, the album has sold 729,000 copies in the US. The Reminder was also the best selling album of 2007 on the iTunes Store.
On November 25, 2008, the Deluxe Edition released as a two-disc package featuring nine bonus tracks on the second disc.
Track 6 of the album, "Sealion" is an adaptation of a song by singer Nina Simone (Broadway-Blues-Ballads, 1964). The original title was "See Line Woman" (a reference to sealions was never intended), and refers to the life of an upper class prostitute.
Confirmed singles include "My Moon My Man", "1234", "I Feel It All" and "Honey Honey". The "My Moon My Man" single includes a remix by German electronic musician Boys Noize. Videos were directed by Patrick Daughters, who also directed the video for "Mushaboom". During September 2007, the song "1234" was featured in Apple's television advertisement for the third generation iPod nano. The advert caused a sudden increase in the song's popularity, which resulted in a surge in the song's chart position. It reached number 8 in the UK Singles Chart on October 7 and number 8 in the Billboard Hot 100 for the week ending October 13. The music video was shot in a single unbroken take after two days of rehearsals. Time magazine named "1234" one of The 10 Best Songs of 2007, ranking it at #2. The song was written by Australian artist Sally Seltmann (aka New Buffalo). Writer Josh Tyrangiel called the song a “masterpiece”, praising Feist for singing it “with a mixture of wisdom and exuberance that's all her own." eBay also used the song in Australian advertisements. Another single, "My Moon My Man" was used in a Verizon Wireless commercial.
This album was No. 35 on Rolling Stone's list of the Top 50 Albums of 2007.
On July 10, 2007, the shortlist for the Polaris Music Prize was revealed. The Reminder was announced as a finalist, alongside such other acts as The Besnard Lakes, Chad VanGaalen, and eventual winner Patrick Watson.
Kaleefa Saneh of The New York Times ranked The Reminder at #1, and John Pareles ranked it at No. 2 on list of the 10 Best Albums of 2007.
Less than a year after its release, Blender listed it 80th on their list of The 100 Greatest Indie-Rock Albums Ever. Online music magazine Pitchfork Media placed The Reminder at number 112 on their list of top 200 albums of the 2000s.
Feist won the 2007 Shortlist Music Prize for The Reminder; she is the second woman (after Cat Power) to ever win the award.
It won Juno Awards in 2008 for Pop Album of the Year and for Album of the Year. After winning her 5 Junos, in Canada her album sales shot back up the chart from No. 12 to No. 2, the position her album debuted at. It was also nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 50th Grammy Awards.
