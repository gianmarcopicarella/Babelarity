Rainford Kalaba (born 14 August 1986 in Kitwe) is a Zambian professional footballer who currently plays for TP Mazembe.
Kalaba signed a five-year contract with Braga in April 2008.
In October 2013, due to a disagreement between their club TP Mazembe and the Zambian Football Association over international call-ups, Kalaba and two other players (Nathan Sinkala and Stoppila Sunzu) were the subject of a Zambian arrest warrant. All three players later had their passports confiscated by Zambian immigration authorities, before being pardoned by the Zambian government.
