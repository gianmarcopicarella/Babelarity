In 2009, he signed for the male lead in the one-hour drama The Dealership, starring opposite Tricia Helfer and William Devane. His television appearances grew over the next few years, from guest appearances on Numb3rs to a recurring role as a love interest for Adrianne Palicki on Friday Night Lights and leads in TV features like the romantic comedy Christmas in Boston.
In 2007, he moved up to guest appearances on top-rated shows like Lost, where he played a young man who sought out John Locke (played by Terry O'Quinn), while maintaining his presence in the Los Angeles theater scene, most notably with an award-winning production of "Marat/Sade," which he produced and directed for the Blue House Theatre Company.
Adams guest starred in Pretty Little Liars, in the 5th episode; "Reality Bites Me" as Ezra Fitz's college friend, Hardy. In summer 2011, he began starring in the co-lead role of Mike Ross in Suits on the basic-cable USA Network, after being fired from the pilot of NBCâ€™s Friends With Benefits.
