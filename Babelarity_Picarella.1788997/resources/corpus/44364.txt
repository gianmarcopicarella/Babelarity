"Take Over Control" is a song by Dutch-born producer and DJ Afrojack, featuring vocals from Dutch singer-songwriter Eva Simons. The song was written by Afrojack, Eva, Ingrid Simons, and Mike Hamilton. It was released in the Netherlands on 12 August 2010. The song was number one for six weeks on Billboard's Hot Dance Airplay. Despite that, the song never cracked the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 41.
The music video, directed by Alex Herron, was shot on 14 September 2010 in Los Angeles and Death Valley, California. The video premiered on YouTube on 12 October 2010 through the Spinnin' Records account, and later shown to the UK public on 20 October 2010 through the Data Records account.
The video starts with Afrojack driving an Audi R8 in a desert. Simons, depicted as a robotic dancer in a quite stereotypical yellow American school bus, is accompanied by four robotic background dancers. They step out of the bus and perform a high-energy dance routine in a desert aircraft boneyard, with Simons framed in an L-1011 Rolls-Royce RB211 engine cowling. The girls take control of the field, but fall out of energy, and Afrojack arrives and plugs them in so that they can continue performing.
