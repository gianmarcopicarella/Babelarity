Temple University History
Temple University was founded in 1884 by Russell Conwell, a Yale-educated Boston lawyer, orator, and ordained Baptist minister, who had served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Conwell came to Pennsylvania in 1882 to lead the Grace Baptist Church while he began tutoring working class citizens late at night to accommodate their work schedules. These students, later dubbed "night owls," were taught in the basement of Conwell's Baptist Temple, hence the origin of the university's name and mascot. The Grace Baptist Church quickly grew popular within the North Philadelphia area. A temporary board of trustees was created to handle the rapidly growing formalities associated with the church's programs. When the board conducted its first meeting they named Russell H. Conwell president of "The Temple College." Within the following months, Grace Baptist Church appointed a new board of trustees, printed official admissions files, and issued stock to raise funds for new teaching facilities. Regardless of whether they had the resources to support the school, Conwell’s desire was “to give education to those who were unable to get it through the usual channels”.
Philadelphia granted a charter in 1888 to establish “The Temple College of Philadelphia”, but the city refused to grant authority to award academic degrees. By 1888, the enrollment of the college was nearly 600. It was in 1907 that Temple College revised its institutional status and incorporated as a university. Legal recognition as a university enhanced Temple in noticeable ways including its reputation, professional and graduate programs, overall enrollment, and financial support.
Over time, Temple expanded: Samaritan Hospital was founded, a Medical School was added, and Temple merged with the Philadelphia Dental College. After the merger, Temple officially reincorporated as Temple University on December 12, 1907.
Today, Temple is a Pennsylvania state-related university, meaning the university receives state funds, subject to state appropriations, but is independently operated.
Temple University offers more than 400 degree programs at 17 schools and colleges and five professional schools, including programs in art, business, communications, education, engineering, liberal arts, music, science, and the health professions.

In 2009, Temple announced Temple 20/20, a framework to guide development at its main campus. Among its goals, it will make Broad Street the center point of the university and include a new library for students and the community; a large new green space; a new science building and a high rise residence hall. Highlights and progress have been reported by Philadelphia media. The plan looks to expand Temple's structure of modernization exponentially, as well as improve the North Philadelphia community.
In accordance with the 20/20 plan, Temple wants to improve its most valuable piece of property, Broad Street. Improvements to Broad Street will likely include a new library, a signature building and more shopping and dining areas. Parking features will be expanded vertically with multi-level parking garages, instead of taking up valuable property space. Another renovation, completed in 2010, was the transformation of the Baptist Temple into a 36,000-square-foot (3,300 m2) performance and event center.
Under the plan, the 105-acre (0.42 km2) campus will remain the same size, with buildings growing vertically or going in place of current buildings. To make the campus more open to the surrounding community, iron fencing will be removed from the boundaries. The plan is designed to open up the campus; bring students out onto Broad Street and contribute to the development of North Philadelphia and the city itself.
20/20 projects include:
Opened January 2012, 50,000 square feet. The design incorporates an innovative glass curtain wall exterior “skin” that allows daylight to flood interior studios and classrooms while also providing dynamic views of the surrounding urban environment.

Because the NCAA Tournament was not held until the following year, Temple's NIT championship earned the Owls the first national college basketball title. During the 1950s, the Temple basketball team made two NCAA Final Four appearances (1956, 1958) under legendary Head Coach Harry Litwack. Litwack would be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame after concluding a 21-year coaching career that included 373 wins.
Head Coach John Chaney, who is also a Hall of Fame coach, won a total of 724 career games and took Temple to the NCAA tournament 17 times. His 1987–88 Owls team entered the NCAA tournament ranked #1 in the country, and he has reached the Elite Eight on five different occasions. He was consensus national coach of the year in 1988.
On April 10, 2006, University of Pennsylvania head coach and La Salle University alumnus Fran Dunphy was named the new Temple's Men's Head Basketball coach after Chaney's retirement in conclusion of the 2006 season. Dunphy had coached the Quakers for 17 straight seasons prior to the move. Dunphy and the Owls won three straight Atlantic-10 tournaments in 2008, 2009 and 2010, with the third marking a conference-leading ninth A-10 title. In the 2011-12 season, the Owls won the A-10 regular season title.
Heading into the 2015-16 season, the program owns a 116-year win-loss record of 1,849-1,024.

Cherry and White are the official school colors of Temple University. Temple was the first school in the nation to officially use cherry as one of its colors, and the only other current school uses the cherry and white combination: Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. The only other large university that uses cherry is the University of New Mexico. Cherry is a common motif at Temple, from the Cherry Crusade fan club to the Cherry and White Directory. In 2008, Temple standardized the cherry color to be Pantone Matching System (PMS) 201.
The university's symbol, the Temple "T", was designed by Kristine Herrick at Temple's Tyler School of Art. It won a contest launched by President Peter J. Liacouras to celebrate the school's 100th anniversary, and was officially adopted in 1983. The Temple T is referenced in the fight song, T For Temple U'.
Temple adopted the owl as its mascot in 1888, the first school in the nation to choose the bird. The nocturnal hunter symbolized Temple's early mission: to be a night school for ambitious young people of limited means. Russell Conwell encouraged these students, saying, "The owl of the night makes the eagle of the day." In 1977, Temple introduced "Victor T. Owl," a costumed mascot. Victor T. was renamed Hooter in 1984, and Hooter has remained Temple's mascot at sports games and events since. Stella, Temple's live owl mascot, was born in 2010 in Washington. She arrived in Pennsylvania in 2011 and lives in the Elmwood Park Zoo in Norristown, Pennsylvania. Stella is one of two live owl mascots in Division 1 athletics, the other being Florida Atlantic University's Hera.
T For Temple U is a cheer performed at many athletic events. The song was written in the 1980s by a member of the Temple University Diamond Marching Band. T For Temple U is accompanied by arm motions that create the shapes of the letters T and U. It is played at sporting events, pep rallies, and school celebrations. Temple's official fight song is "Fight, Temple, Fight!"
The Alumni Circle is near the Founder's Garden on Liacouras Walk. The monument's structure is designed to reflect sound, particularly human voices. It was donated by the architecture class of 1989, is a common stop for tours of campus and a popular site visited by alumni.
The Bell Tower sits at 110 ft. tall in the center of the Main Campus between Paley Library and Beury Hall. The surrounding plaza and grassy area, the largest "green space" on the urban campus, are commonly called "the beach". The area is a meeting place and hangout location for students and their protests, promotions, speeches, political campaigning, and charity drives. It also hosts various official events such as Spring Fling.
The garden is behind the Alumni Circle, off of Liacouras Walk. It is the burial place of Russell Conwell, founder and 38-year president of Temple. A former Yale student, Civil War captain, Boston lawyer, and Philadelphia minister, Conwell used the income from his famous “Acres of Diamonds” speech to fund Temple as a place where working-class Philadelphians might receive higher education. It has been estimated that Conwell, who died at 82, helped more than 100,000 men and women pursue higher education. A bust of Conwell marks his grave.
Off the faculty staff dining 'Diamond Club', this green area celebrates Conwell and Johnny Ring. It is often used for wedding photos.
As of 2012, there were 260,000 living Temple alumni in all 50 states and 145 countries.

Temple has two mass notification systems for emergencies, TUalert and TUsiren.
On April 2, 1965, Lester B. Pearson, Prime Minister of Canada and recipient of the Nobel peace prize was awarded the Temple University World Peace Prize. During his acceptance speech Pearson criticised American bombing of Vietnam:
There are many factors which I am not in a position to weigh. But there does appear to be at least a possibility that a suspension of such air strikes against North Vietnam, at the right time, might provide the Hanoi [communist] authorities with an opportunity, if they wish to take it, to inject some flexibility into their policy without appearing to do so as the direct result of military pressure.
The speech infuriated President Lyndon B. Johnson who, the next day at Camp David, took Pearson out onto the terrace and began "laying into [Pearson] in no uncertain fashion". Pearson later apologized for the speech.
