The 2009–10 Premier League (known as the Barclays Premier League for sponsorship reasons) was the 18th season of the Premier League since its establishment in 1992. A total of 20 teams competed in the league, with Chelsea unseating the three-time defending champions Manchester United, scoring a Premier League record 103 goals in the process. The season began on 15 August 2009 and concluded on 9 May 2010. Prior to each opening week match, a minute's applause was held in memory of Sir Bobby Robson. Nike provided a new match ball – the T90 Ascente – for this season.
The race for the title went to the final day of the season with Chelsea one point ahead of Manchester United; Chelsea's 8–0 win over Wigan Athletic was enough to secure their first title since 2006, despite Manchester United's 4–0 defeat of Stoke City. The title win came in Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti's first season at the club and he followed this up a week later by securing Chelsea's first FA Cup and League double with a win over Portsmouth at Wembley. Chelsea striker Didier Drogba won the Golden Boot award as the league's top goalscorer for the second time The victorious Chelsea side were noted for their attacking style of football: the team averaged 2.71 goals per game, scoring a Premier League record 103 goals for the season, compared to the average of 1.89 when they won the title in the 2004–05 and 2005–06 seasons.
In February 2010, Portsmouth became the first club to go into administration whilst a member of the Premier League. They were docked nine points, and two months later they were the first team of the season to be relegated. Hull City and Premier League debutants Burnley were relegated alongside them.
Pre-season was overshadowed by the death of Sir Bobby Robson on 31 July. On the opening games of the season players stood around the centre circle for a minute's applause for the former Newcastle United, Fulham, Ipswich Town, Barcelona, Porto, PSV Eindhoven and England manager who died at the age of 76.
Chelsea won the league by a point over second placed Manchester United on 9 May 2010, with an 8–0 win at home to Wigan Athletic. They won despite Manchester United's 4–0 win against Stoke. The title win came in Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti's first season with the club. Portsmouth were the first team to be relegated on 10 April 2010, followed by Hull City and Burnley. Fulham's manager Roy Hodgson was voted manager of the year by the League Managers Association. The season saw Liverpool, runners-up the previous season and considered one of the established 'Big Four', finish outside the top four for the first time since 2004–05 leaving them unable to compete in the UEFA Champions League for the first time since the 2003–04 season.
Newcastle United, Middlesbrough and West Bromwich Albion were relegated to the 2009–10 Football League Championship after finishing the 2008–09 season in the bottom three places. Newcastle suffered their first relegation from the Premier League since their promotion to it in 1993. Middlesbrough returned to the Championship after an eleven-year tenure in England's top flight, while West Bromwich's latest stint in the Premier League lasted only one season.
The three relegated teams were replaced by 2008–09 Football League Championship champions Wolverhampton Wanderers, runners-up Birmingham City and promotion play-off winners Burnley. Wolverhampton play their first season at the top level since the 2003–04 season, and Burnley made their return to England's highest football division after 33 years. Fellow promoted club Birmingham City, on the other hand, had changed divisions between the Premier League and the Championship for the fourth season in a row.
Manchester United came into the season as defending champions and aiming to win a fourth successive Premier League title, following championship-winning campaigns in 2006–07, 2007–08 and 2008–09. They were also looking to overtake Liverpool's record of 18 league titles.
The league comprised five teams from London (Arsenal, Chelsea, Fulham, Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United); four clubs from the Midlands (Aston Villa, Birmingham City, Stoke City and Wolverhampton Wanderers); eight teams from the north-west (Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Burnley, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, and Wigan Athletic); and one each from the north-east (Sunderland), Yorkshire and the Humber (Hull City), and the south (Portsmouth).

This season was the last of a three-year domestic television rights deal agreed in 2006. Television rights continue to provide a large portion of Premier League clubs' revenue. However, on 19 June 2009, the Premier League annulled its contract with Ireland-based broadcaster Setanta Sports after the company failed to pay an instalment to the league with speculation mounting that the company would enter administration. As a result, Setanta Sports' share was bought by United States-based broadcasters ESPN, while Sky Sports continue to hold four of the six 23-live match packages. In the United States, the Disney-owned network is making use of sibling-network ESPN2 to televise early Saturday matches and Monday matches. This was possible due to Setanta Sports' financial troubles, which required their USA-based North America division to sell its rights to those games back to Fox Sports International, who in turn sublicensed them to ESPN. Setanta continues to broadcast a reduced number of matches in Ireland. In Australia, most games are available live on Fox Sports. Sentanta Sports USA operations ceased on 28 February, and Fox Soccer Plus replaced Sentanta as a pay service the following day.
On 31 January 2010, Sky Sports broadcast the match between Arsenal and Manchester United in 3D. The 3D broadcast was shown at nine pubs in London, Manchester, Cardiff, Edinburgh and Dublin, making the match the first sports event to be televised in 3D to a public audience anywhere in the world.
