Dieter Müller (born Dieter Kaster on 1 April 1954) is a former German footballer.
He appeared in twelve senior matches, scoring nine goals for West Germany. He played in the 1976 European Football Championship (in the final of which he scored) and the 1978 FIFA World Cup. In his spell with 1. FC Köln he set a record for the most goals scored by a player in a single Bundesliga match. On 17 August 1977, he contributed six goals (scoring in the 12th, 23rd, 32nd, 52nd, 73rd and in the 85th minute) to Köln's 7–2 victory over Werder Bremen in front of a crowd of 19,000 at Köln's Müngersdorfer Stadion. But since the cameramen were on strike on this day, there are no TV-recordings of Müller's goals. He was crowned Bundesliga topscorer that season (24 goals in 33 games), just like the season before (34 goals in 34 appearances). Overall he scored 177 goals in the West German top flight in 303 games.
He is the son of Heinz Kaster, who played as a defender for FC St. Pauli and Kickers Offenbach in the early 1950s. The striker had already been a schoolboy international, when his stepfather's adoption turned his surname into Müller.
He was struck by a family tragedy. His son Alexander, aged 16, died of a brain tumor in 1997.
Müller suffered a severe heart attack on 5 October 2012 and fell into a five-day coma.
