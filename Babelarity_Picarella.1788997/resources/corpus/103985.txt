The Herald Republican, the daily newspaper based in Angola and serving Steuben County, was formed through the merger of two longstanding weekly newspapers in Angola, the Steuben Republican (first published in May 1857) and The Angola Herald (January 1876). The newspapers consolidated their printing plants in 1925 and their ownership in the 1960s (in the Willis family), eventually merging into one publication in 1980. Two years later they were sold to Home News Enterprises, which expanded the paper to a twice-weekly format in 1989, and then in August 2001 to KPC Media Group of Kendallville, Indiana, which converted The Herald Republican to a daily in September 2001.
