Lorenzo Ebecilio (born 24 September 1991) is a Dutch professional footballer who plays as a left winger for Anzhi Makhachkala.
Ebecilio started his career with VV de Blokkers, an amateur club from Hoorn. He would later play in the youth teams of HVV Hollandia and AZ.
On 27 October 2005, several months following the death of his father, the fourteen-year-old Ebecilio had a heart attack and had to have a defibrillator surgically implanted. He was forced to leave AZ due to these health concerns, and the player returned to HVV Hollandia. He no longer has any problems related to his heart following the surgery. Ajax subsequently offered him a place in their youth academy.
At Ajax, Ebecilio played for Jong Ajax under manager Frank de Boer. On 12 December 2010, six days after the departure of Martin Jol and the installation of De Boer as caretaker manager, Ebecilio made his debut in the first team of Ajax, being in the starting line-up in an away victory over Vitesse Arnhem. The player also appeared in the starting line-up in the last game of 2010, in a 1–0 victory over former club AZ, playing the full 90 minutes. He was named man-of-the-match in the game against his former club.
2011 began much like 2010 had ended, with the player being in the starting line-up for the league matches against Feyenoord, FC Utrecht, NAC Breda, and De Graafschap. On 17 February 2011, Ebecilio made his European debut in the 3–0 Europa League away victory over Anderlecht. Ebecilio participated in most of Ajax matches during the second half of the season, ultimately leading to the Dutch league championship. Ebecilio also appeared in the KNVB Cup final against FC Twente. Ajax lost the final with 3–2, despite one goal of Ebecilio. On 4 March 2012, Ebecilio scored his first hat-trick for Ajax in a 4–1 win over Roda JC.
The 2012–13 season saw Ebecilio receiving much less playing time. On 2 January 2013, Marc Overmars announced the transfer of Ebecilio to Ukrainian club Metalurh Donetsk on a three-year contract, for a sum of €500.000.
On 5 June 2013, it was announced that Ebecilio had signed a one-year loan deal with Azerbaijan Premier League team Gabala. Ebecilio made his debut for Gabala on 2 August 2013, Gabala's first games of the 2013–14 season against Baku. His first goal for Gabala came in his fifth game, a 3–2 home victory over Inter Baku on 31 August 2013.
Following the end of his Gabala contract, Ebecilio followed Ibrahima Niasse and Yuri Semin to Mordovia Saransk, by joining the club on trial. On 24 July 2014, Ebecilio joined Mordovia Saransk on a season-long loan deal. During his league debut for Mordovia, on 2 August, Ebecilio fractured his tibia in a challenge with Chisamba Lungu, and was ruled out for around six months.
On 7 July 2015, Ebecilio signed for Anzhi Makhachkala on a three-year contract, linking up with Yuri Semin for a third season.
Ebecilio has represented Netherlands U-17 and Netherlands U-19. He represented the Netherlands in the 2008 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship and the 2010 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship. On 9 February 2011, Ebecilio made his debut for Netherlands U-21 in a match against the Czech Republic.
