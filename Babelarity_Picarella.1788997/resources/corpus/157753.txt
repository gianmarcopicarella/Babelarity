Foard County was once a stronghold for the Democratic Party at both the state and federal level, both by Solid South standards and as the rest of north Texas and the rural parts of the state trended towards the Republican Party. The county last voted for a Democratic presidential candidate when it gave its votes to Bill Clinton in 1996. At the statewide level, most notably in recent gubernatorial races, the county was one of the few rural ones that continued to give its votes to Democratic candidates in this area, even as it trended Republican on the national level. For instance, in the landslide reelection of then-governor George W. Bush in 1998, it was one of only 14 counties that gave its votes to Bush's Democratic challenger Garry Mauro. The county continued this trend through all of Rick Perry's three gubernatorial landslide elections in 2002, 2006, and 2010, the most recent one when it gave its votes to Bill White. This streak ended in 2014, when the county gave its votes to then-Attorney General Greg Abbott, who won over 70% of the popular vote over Wendy Davis.
