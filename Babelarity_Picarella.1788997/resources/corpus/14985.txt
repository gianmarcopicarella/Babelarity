Michal Březina (Czech pronunciation: [ˈmɪxal ˈbr̝ɛzɪna]; born 30 March 1990) is a Czech figure skater. He is the 2013 European bronze medalist, 2011 Skate America champion, 2009 World Junior silver medalist, and 2010 Czech national champion. He is also the winner of the 2014-15 ISU Challenger Series.
Michal Březina was born in Brno, the son of Edita Březinová and Rudolf Březina, a figure skating coach. He is the elder brother of Eliška Březinová, a competitor in ladies' singles. He intends to study sports at university and to eventually become a skating coach.
Březina was the best man at the wedding of Anna Cappellini and Ondřej Hotárek in the summer of 2015.
On May 19, 2015, Brezina announced he was engaged to his girlfriend, fellow figure skater Danielle Montalbano.
Březina was initially interested in ice hockey after watching the 1998 Winter Olympics but his father advised him to learn to skate first, and after a few months, he dropped hockey to focus on figure skating.
Březina first landed a triple Salchow at the age of 12, and a triple Axel at 15. In practice, he has worked on a quad toe loop and quad Salchow. He trained in his hometown of Brno with coach Petr Starec and in Oberstdorf, Germany with Karel Fajfr.
Březina won the 2007 Nebelhorn Trophy over compatriot and reigning champion, Tomáš Verner. Two weeks later, he won his first Junior Grand Prix medal, a silver, in Chemnitz. Březina placed 16th at his first European Championships. He missed training time because of a broken wrist, but was able to compete at the World Junior Championships, where he was 5th.
In the 2008–09 season, Březina won both his junior Grand Prix events, but was forced to miss the Junior Grand Prix Final and the Czech national championships due to a right knee injury that required surgery. He returned in time for the 2009 Europeans, where he finished 10th, and then set a new personal best at the 2009 Junior Worlds to win the silver medal behind Adam Rippon.
In 2009–10, Březina debuted on the senior Grand Prix circuit, finishing fourth at the 2009 Skate Canada International. He won the bronze medal at 2009 NHK Trophy, and defeated Tomáš Verner to win the Czech Championship. He finished 4th at the 2010 European Championships. At the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver he came in 10th. Competing at his first senior World Championships, he earned a fourth-place finish with a new personal best score of 236.06.
During the 2010–11 Grand Prix season, Březina was forced to withdraw from the 2010 Cup of China after undergoing surgery for a varicose vein in his abdomen. He later withdrew from the 2010 Trophée Eric Bompard as well. He took silver behind Verner at the Czech Championships. At the 2011 European Championships, Březina placed second in the short program but dropped to 8th overall following the free skate. At the 2011 World Championships, he successfully landed two quads, a Salchow and a toe loop, in the long program – his first quads landed in competition – but fell on two jumps toward the end of the program. He finished fourth at the event for the second straight year.
Březina experienced some boot problems during the off-season. He trained mainly in Oberstdorf. He began the 2011–12 season at 2011 Nebelhorn Trophy where he won the silver medal. Skaters who had placed in the top six at the 2011 Worlds were given a newly introduced option of competing at three Grand Prix events. Březina elected to do so, and was assigned to 2011 Skate America, 2011 Trophée Eric Bompard, and 2011 Cup of Russia. At Skate America, he won the short program by 8.39 points and placed third in the free skate to win the gold medal overall. Březina won the bronze medal in France which qualified him for the Grand Prix Final. He then placed fourth in Cup of Russia. He was sixth at the Grand Prix Final. At the 2012 World Championships, Březina picked up a small silver medal for the short program and finished 6th overall after the free skate. In April 2012, he changed coaches from Starec and Fajfr to Viktor Petrenko. He trains at the Ice House in Hackensack, New Jersey.
In the 2012–13 season, Březina finished 6th at 2012 Skate America and won the bronze medal at the 2012 Rostelecom Cup. He withdrew from the Czech Championships due to a fever. He dislocated his shoulder during practice on 21 January at the 2013 European Championships but went on to win bronze, his first European medal.
In February 2014, Březina placed tenth at the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. His next event was the 2014 World Championships in Saitama, Japan. He withdrew after the short program on 26 March, having pulled ligaments in his right ankle on the triple flip take-off. His ankle was immediately put into a cast and he recovered in two weeks. Due to the high cost of training in the United States, he decided in June 2014 to rejoin Karel Fajfr in Oberstdorf.
For the 2014–15 Grand Prix season, Brezina was selected to compete at the 2014 Skate Canada International and 2014 Rostelecom Cup.
