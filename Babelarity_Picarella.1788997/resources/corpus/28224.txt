Artaphernes, son of Artaphernes, was the nephew of Darius the Great, and a general of the Achaemenid Empire.
He was appointed, together with Datis, to take command of the expedition sent by Darius to punish Athens and Eretria for their support for the Ionian Revolt. Artaphernes and Datis besieged and destroyed Eretria, but were beaten by the Athenians at the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC.  Ten years later, Artaphernes is recorded as being in command of the Lydians and Mysians.
