Goran Pandev (Macedonian: Горан Пандев [ˈɡɔran ˈpandɛf]; born 27 July 1983) is a Macedonian footballer who plays for Genoa as a forward. He is a key player for the Macedonian national team, being the country's all-time top scorer with 26 goals.
After establishing himself at Lazio, Pandev moved to Inter Milan in early 2010. While playing for the Nerazzurri, Pandev collected a host of honours including winning the 2009–10 Serie A, the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League, and the 2010 FIFA Club World Cup.
Pandev was born in Strumica, SR Macedonia, then still part of SFR Yugoslavia, and began his football career with FK Belasica, the club with which he progressed through the youth academy. He only spent one season in the local Prva Liga, however, before being signed by Serie A giants Internazionale in the summer of 2001 when he was just 18 years old.
Inter loaned Pandev to Spezia, where he was a regular in Serie C1. The following year, he was again sent on loan, this time to newly promoted Serie A club Ancona. During his time at Ancona, the team had the worst season of any club in Serie A history.
In January 2004, Serbian player Dejan Stanković was signed by Inter from Lazio and Pandev was sent to the capital in exchange on a co-ownership deal, for a nominal fee of €500, but he remained at Ancona until end of 2003–04 season. Pandev impressed in his first year at Lazio, as he made 29 appearances, scoring three goals, which included a memorable effort away to Juventus where he beat Fabio Cannavaro, Lilian Thuram and Gianluca Zambrotta before beating Gianluigi Buffon with an angled shot. In July 2005, 50 percent of his player registration rights were transferred to Udinese in exchange for David Pizarro's transfer to the Milanese club.
The following season, Delio Rossi was appointed manager of Lazio and Pandev began to form a deadly strike partnership with Tommaso Rocchi. In June 2006, Lazio bought the remaining 50 percent of his registration rights from Udinese for €4 million.
On 11 January 2009, Pandev scored his first hat-trick in Serie A against Reggina.
On 24 March 2009, Pandev was awarded the Medal for Service to the Country by the then-President Branko Crvenkovski in acknowledgement of his sporting achievements and his contribution to developing and popularizing sport in Macedonia as well as promoting the country abroad.
In the summer of 2009, a dispute between Pandev and Lazio President Claudio Lotito erupted, resulting in a legal battle between Pandev and his club. The ruling was announced on 23 December 2009.
The dispute started with Pandev indicating his desire to leave Lazio during the summer of 2009. President Lotito, apparently unhappy with Pandev's decision, froze him out of the squad. As a result, Pandev spent the remaining four months training on his own, without making a single appearance for his club. During this period, various clubs had indicated their interest in buying Pandev, most notably Zenit Saint Petersburg, who made an offer of €13 million for the player. Lazio President Lotito rejected the offer, demanding €15 million instead. The deal eventually fell through after both parties failed to come to an agreement on price.
On 26 September, Pandev officially filed for a termination of his contract with Lazio, having been frozen out of the squad and labelled a "rebel" by the club. Pandev argued that by freezing him out of the squad, Lazio had violated the terms of their contract with him. On 23 December 2009, the Lega Nazionale Professionisti ruled in Pandev's favor, ordering Lazio to release Pandev from his contract and pay him €170,000 for emotional distress. Lotito indicated his desire to appeal the decision.
On 4 January 2010, Pandev signed a four-and-a-half year contract with Inter, wearing the number 27 shirt. He made his Inter debut as a starter in the 1–0 away win against Chievo on 6 January. His first two games for the Nerazzurri resulted in him contributing to both winners — setting up Mario Balotelli against Chievo and setting up Walter Samuel to score a last minute winner against Siena. His first goal for Inter arrived against Bari, pulling a goal back for Inter after falling behind by two goals. Three minutes later, he earned a penalty that levelled the score. In the 2–0 victory over local rivals A.C. Milan, he assisted Diego Milito with an overhead cross and scored a curling freekick to complete the win. On 22 May 2010, Inter won the UEFA Champions League in the final against Bayern Munich, with Pandev becoming the third Macedonian football player in history to ever win this championship.
On 16 December 2010, Inter had reached the final of FIFA Club World Cup. Pandev scored his first goal in FIFA Club World Cup and his first goal in a major final. He is also the first ever Macedonian to score and win the FIFA Club World Cup Championship. In the Round of 16 of the UEFA Champions league, he scored Inter's third decisive goal against Bayern Munich.
On 26 August 2011, Pandev joined Napoli on a season-long loan. On 10 September, Pandev came on as a substitute to make his Napoli debut against Cesena in the 66th minute with the score tied at 1–1. Despite Napoli making it 2–1 in their favour right after the Macedonian striker came on, Pandev missed an open goal in the 85th minute, hitting the crossbar from six yards out after a square pass across the face of goal was played to him; Napoli managed to win the match 3–1.
On 29 November, Pandev came in for an injured Edinson Cavani and started a home game against rivals Juventus. He scored two goals, the first of which was his first for Napoli, and the second a volleyed goal. The two goals put Napoli up 3–1 but Juventus came back to tie the game at 3–3, the final score. Pandev then went on to score his third Serie A goal for Napoli in their 6–1 pummeling of Genoa on 21 December.
Following the winter break, Pandev netted his side's opening goal in a 1–3 win in Sicily over Palermo on 8 January 2012.
On 20 May 2012, Pandev won another Coppa Italia and has been on the winning side in the past four consecutive years.
On 6 June 2012, Pandev made a permanent switch from Inter to Napoli. Later, Napoli President Aurelio De Laurentiis noted on a radio interview that Pandev had taken a pay cut to join the Neapolitans, with the President noting this as a sign of commitment to the club and fans.
On 28 September 2013, Pandev scored both goals in Napoli's win over Genoa, sending the Neapolitans to the top of the league table.
Pandev came on in place of Gonzalo Higuaín for the last 20 minutes of the 2014 Coppa Italia Final, which Napoli won 3–1 against Fiorentina.
On 1 September 2014, Pandev signed a two-year contract with Turkish giants Galatasaray.
Pandev signed a two-year contract with Italian club Genoa after failing to get playing time at Galatasaray. He will join the club at the start of the 2015–16 season.
Pandev has won 75 caps for Macedonia, scoring 26 goals. With his two goals against Spain, he became the national team's all-time leading scorer, surpassing Gjorgji Hristov.
Pandev is a quick, creative, and hard-working left-footed forward with good technique, who is capable both of creating and scoring goals, due to his opportunism and shooting accuracy, as well as his vision and passing ability. He is capable of playing in several offensive positions, either on the right or through the centre of the pitch, and he is usually deployed in a supporting role, as a winger, as a second striker, or as an attacking midfielder, although he has also been fielded as a striker.
