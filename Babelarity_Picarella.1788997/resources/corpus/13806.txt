David James Marshall (born 5 March 1985) is a Scottish professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Welsh club Cardiff City and the Scotland national team.
He started his career at Celtic coming through the youth system and followed on to Norwich City (initially on loan) before his move to Wales.
Marshall was born in Glasgow. A product of Celtic's youth academy, he made his first team debut for the club as a substitute against St Johnstone at Celtic Park. Although first team opportunities were limited, he excelled in Celtic's reserve team under the management of then coach, Kenny McDowall.
Marshall was thrust in to the limelight soon after these impressive displays for Celtic reserves on 25 March 2004 in a fourth round, second leg UEFA Cup tie against Spanish giants FC Barcelona at Camp Nou. The 19-year-old, deputising for a suspended Rab Douglas, put in an excellent performance to keep a clean sheet to help Celtic into the next round (1–0 on aggregate) after a home win and he then went on to save a penalty from Barcelona's Ronaldinho the following season.
However his Celtic career took a downward turn under Gordon Strachan's management. In the first two games under Strachan he conceded 9 goals, 5 to Artmedia Petržalka and 4 to Motherwell. With the signing of Artur Boruc, Marshall was consigned to the bench and remained there for the following 18 months before being sent on loan to Norwich City.
His Norwich debut was against Blackpool. Marshall was sidelined for the remainder of the 2006–07 season due to an injury sustained in the FA Cup fourth round tie with Chelsea after falling awkwardly on his ankle, and returned to Celtic.
On 4 July 2007, Marshall signed a three-year contract with Norwich for an undisclosed fee. Marshall impressed in his pre-season appearances for the club, performing well against Vitesse Arnhem and West Ham United in particular.
Before Norwich's last home game of the 2007–08 season against Queens Park Rangers at Carrow Road, Marshall came third in the voting for Norwich City player of the year after a string of impressive displays. He was the only member of the squad to have played every minute of every game in the season.
On 12 May 2009, following Norwich's relegation, Marshall signed for Championship side Cardiff City in a deal worth up to £500,000. He was chosen as the first choice goalkeeper over Finland international Peter Enckelman by manager Dave Jones, making his debut on the opening day of the season in a 4–0 win over Scunthorpe United before conceding his first goal in a 1–1 draw with Blackpool in the following match. Marshall let in three goals in his first South Wales Derby where City went on to lose 3–2 to Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium. Marshall suffered an injury in a 2–1 loss against Ipswich Town, resulting in Peter Enckelman coming on for the last 45 minutes and two goals being scored. Marhsall did recover in time for the next game, were Cardiff beat Preston North End 1–0. After his quick return Marshall kept three consecutive clean sheets the other two coming against West Bromwich Albion and Middlesbrough and also making 150th league appearance against Middlesbrough.
Marshall retained his first team place for the first two months of the following season, before being dropped for second choice keeper, Tom Heaton after a 2–0 defeat to Ipswich Town. Marshall didn't see first team football until the beginning of December in a 1–1 draw with Preston North End but only managed to start the next four games before being injured. But he managed to make his final appearance of the 2010–11 season in a FA Cup game against Stoke City before receiving an elbow injury which ended his season, after it was confirmed he needed elbow surgery.
Marshall returned the following pre-season as first-choice goalkeeper, starting all the warm-up games under new manager and fellow Scotsman, Malky Mackay. He made his full return in the opening game against West Ham United, which Cardiff won 1–0. He made his 100th appearance for the club during the season in a goalless draw with Burnley. Cardiff finished in the play-off a third successive season but lost 5–0 to West Ham United in the semi-finals. At the end of the season, Marshall was out of contract but on 23 May, he signed a new three-year deal keeping him in Cardiff till 2015.
Marshall made his one hundredth league appearance for Cardiff City on 17 August 2012, the opening day of the 2012–13 season against Huddersfield Town, a game in which he also won man of the match. With manager Malky Mackay describing Marshall as the best goalkeeper in the Football League, the shot-stopper kept eighteen clean sheets in the 2012-13 season, more than any other Championship goalkeeper, and was a strong contender for City's Player of The Season Award as the Welsh club achieved promotion to the Premier League.
On 5 February 2014, Marshall signed a new contract keeping him at Cardiff City until 2018.
On 21 April 2014, Marshall was named in Sky Sports' Premier League 'Team of the season'.
After his standout performance for Celtic against FC Barcelona in the 2003–04 UEFA Cup, Marshall was selected by Scotland national football team, making his debut on 18 August 2004 in a friendly against Hungary. Some observers expected Marshall to establish himself as the first choice goalkeeper for Scotland, but Craig Gordon and then Allan McGregor were picked more regularly instead.
He was capped four times by the under-21 team from 2005 to 2006, having previously played at youth international level. He was selected for the Scotland B side in a friendly played at the end of the 2008–09 season.
Marshall stated in May 2009 that he aimed to reignite his career for the national team. With first choice keeper Craig Gordon injured, he went on to play in two of Scotland's following three matches, a 4–0 defeat to Norway and a 1–0 defeat to Netherlands. Marshall performed creditably against the Dutch, but Scotland had lost in all of his five appearances to date, conceding 15 goals in total.
An injury to McGregor and Gordon being without a club early in the 2012–13 season appeared to have offered an opportunity for Marshall, but Matt Gilks made his debut instead. Marshall was part of a winning Scottish side on his eighth cap against Macedonia with Scotland winning 2-1, However he was injured during the game and replaced by Matt Gilks at half time. Marshall won his tenth cap on 19 November 2013 in a friendly away against Norway, keeping a clean sheet and producing several good saves in a 1-0 win for Scotland.
