Club Sportivo Luqueño is a Paraguayan football club, based in the city of Luque on the outskirts of the capital Asunción. Hitherto, the club has won two Paraguayan championship titles.
The club was founded in 1921 when three teams from the city of Luque (Marte Atlético, General Aquino and Vencedor) decided to merge and form one single club: Sportivo Luqueño. Only three years after its foundation, the team was already playing in the first division and fighting for the title. So far, Sportivo Luqueño has won three first division titles in the Paraguayan league, in 1951, 1953 and 2007.
For the 1999 Copa América, hosted by Paraguay, the club built a brand new stadium which seats 25,000, making it the third largest in Paraguay (after the Defensores del Chaco in Asunción and the Estadio Antonio Oddone Sarubbi in Ciudad del Este).
The fans of the club are very passionate and that can be seen when visiting the city of Luque, where basically everything is decorated by the club's colors (blue and yellow).
