Ros (Ukrainian: Рось; Ros’) is a river in Ukraine, 346 km in length, a right tributary of the Dnieper river. The Ros river finds its source in the village of Ordyntsi in Pohrebyschenskyi Raion, Vinnytsia Oblast.
Some historians have suggested the possibility that the name of the Kievan Rus', the old East Slavic state, may have originated from the name of the Ros river, the theory referred to as the antinormanist theory of the origin of Rus'.
