The Moscow Conservatory (Russian: Московская Государственная Консерватория им. П. И. Чайковского, Moscow State Conservatory P. I. Tchaikovsky) is a higher musical education institution in Moscow, and the second oldest conservatory in Russia after St. Petersburg Conservatory. Along with the St. Petersburg Conservatory, it is one of the leading music universities in the country and one of the most prestigious in the world.
It was co-founded in 1866 as the Moscow Imperial Conservatory by Nikolai Rubinstein (brother of the famous Russian pianist and composer Anton Rubinstein, who founded the St. Petersburg Conservatory in 1862) and Prince Nikolai Petrovitch Troubetzkoy.
At its opening, Tchaikovsky was appointed professor of theory and harmony, a post he held until approximately 1878. Since 1940, the conservatory has borne Tchaikovsky's name.
Prior to the Revolution the choral faculty of the conservatory was second to the Moscow Synodal School and Moscow Synodal Choir, but in 1919 both were closed and merged into the choral faculty. Some of the students now listed as being of the conservatory were in fact students of the Synodal School.
The renovation of the hall was completed in 2011.
