Håvard Flo (born 4 April 1970 in Flo, Stryn) is a former football player from Norway. He played for Stryn TIL and Sogndal, before he left Norway in 1994 and played for AGF, SV Werder Bremen, and Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. He returned to Sogndal in 2001. He did a comeback for Sogndal Fotball in 2010.
His most successful spell was in AGF, where he won the Danish Cup in 1996. The same year AGF finished 2nd in the League – behind eventual champions Brøndby. AGF also won a bronzemedal in the "Flo-era". Flo is still remembered in Aarhus as one of the best AGF players ever. In 2008, when Flo first announced his retirement, he returned to Aarhus for a final tribute in the half time break.
He was a member of the Norwegian squad at the 1998 FIFA World Cup in which he also scored in the tie against Scotland, and is a cousin of fellow footballers Jostein Flo, Tore André Flo and Jarle Flo. Håvard Flo's nephew Per Egil Flo also plays for Sogndal. His last match was in the second leg play-off against Aalesunds FK. Sogndal lost 7–2 on aggregate, but he scored the only Sogndal goal away and got applause even from the Aalesund fans.
Flo is a physically strong player, renowned for having a good touch for a big lad.
Danish Cup: 1995–96
