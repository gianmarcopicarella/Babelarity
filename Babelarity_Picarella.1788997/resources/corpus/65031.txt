There are several well-known theorems in functional analysis known as the Riesz representation theorem. They are named in honour of Frigyes Riesz.
This article will describe his theorem concerning the dual of a Hilbert space, which is sometimes called the Fréchet-Riesz theorem. For the theorems relating linear functionals to measures, see Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem.
This theorem establishes an important connection between a Hilbert space and its (continuous) dual space. If the underlying field is the real numbers, the two are isometrically isomorphic; if the underlying field is the complex numbers, the two are isometrically anti-isomorphic. The (anti-) isomorphism is a particular, natural one as will be described next.
Let H be a Hilbert space, and let H* denote its dual space, consisting of all continuous linear functionals from H into the field R or C. If x is an element of H, then the function φx, for all y in H defined by
          φ
            x
        (
        y
        )
        =
          ⟨
          y
          ,
          x
          ⟩
        ,
    {\displaystyle \varphi _{x}(y)=\left\langle y,x\right\rangle ,}
where 
        ⟨
        ⋅
        ,
        ⋅
        ⟩
    {\displaystyle \langle \cdot ,\cdot \rangle }
   denotes the inner product of the Hilbert space, is an element of H*. The Riesz representation theorem states that every element of H* can be written uniquely in this form.
Theorem. The mapping 
        Φ
    {\displaystyle \Phi }
  : H → H* defined by 
        Φ
        (
        x
        )
    {\displaystyle \Phi (x)}
   = 
          φ
            x
    {\displaystyle \varphi _{x}}
   is an isometric (anti-) isomorphism, meaning that:
        Φ
    {\displaystyle \Phi }
   is bijective.
The norms of 
        x
    {\displaystyle x}
   and 
          φ
            x
    {\displaystyle \varphi _{x}}
   agree: 
        ∥
        x
        ∥
        =
        ∥
        Φ
        (
        x
        )
        ∥
    {\displaystyle \Vert x\Vert =\Vert \Phi (x)\Vert }
  .
        Φ
    {\displaystyle \Phi }
   is additive: 
        Φ
        (
          x
            1
        +
          x
            2
        )
        =
        Φ
        (
          x
            1
        )
        +
        Φ
        (
          x
            2
        )
    {\displaystyle \Phi (x_{1}+x_{2})=\Phi (x_{1})+\Phi (x_{2})}
  .
If the base field is R, then 
        Φ
        (
        λ
        x
        )
        =
        λ
        Φ
        (
        x
        )
    {\displaystyle \Phi (\lambda x)=\lambda \Phi (x)}
   for all real numbers λ.
If the base field is C, then 
        Φ
        (
        λ
        x
        )
        =
              λ
              ¯
        Φ
        (
        x
        )
    {\displaystyle \Phi (\lambda x)={\bar {\lambda }}\Phi (x)}
   for all complex numbers λ, where 
              λ
              ¯
    {\displaystyle {\bar {\lambda }}}
   denotes the complex conjugation of λ.
The inverse map of 
        Φ
    {\displaystyle \Phi }
   can be described as follows. Given a non-zero element 
        φ
    {\displaystyle \varphi }
   of H*, the orthogonal complement of the kernel of 
        φ
    {\displaystyle \varphi }
   is a one-dimensional subspace of H. Take a non-zero element z in that subspace, and set 
        x
        =
              φ
              (
              z
              )
            ¯
        ⋅
        z
          /
              ∥
              z
              ∥
            2
    {\displaystyle x={\overline {\varphi (z)}}\cdot z/{\left\Vert z\right\Vert }^{2}}
  . Then 
        Φ
        (
        x
        )
    {\displaystyle \Phi (x)}
   = 
        φ
    {\displaystyle \varphi }
  .
Historically, the theorem is often attributed simultaneously to Riesz and Fréchet in 1907 (see references).
In the mathematical treatment of quantum mechanics, the theorem can be seen as a justification for the popular bra–ket notation. The theorem says that, every bra 
        ⟨
        ψ
          |
    {\displaystyle \langle \psi |}
   has a corresponding ket 
          |
        ψ
        ⟩
    {\displaystyle |\psi \rangle }
  , and the latter is unique.
