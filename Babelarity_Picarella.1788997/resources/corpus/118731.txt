The 18th Academy Awards was the first such ceremony after World War II. As a result, the ceremony featured more glamour than had been present during the war. Plaster statuettes that had been given out during the war years were replaced with bronze statuettes with gold plating. Despite this, director Billy Wilder's grim and socially significant drama The Lost Weekend took the top honors. It became the first film to win both the Academy Award for Best Picture and the Palme d'Or. Joan Crawford was absent, claiming she had pneumonia (although it was said it was because she was sure she would not win the Academy Award for Best Actress for Mildred Pierce). As it turned out she did win, and the award was delivered to her while in bed that night.
Winners are listed first and highlighted in boldface.
