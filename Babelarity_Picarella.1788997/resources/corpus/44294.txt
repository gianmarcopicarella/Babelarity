"Sing for the Moment" is a song by American rapper Eminem from his fourth studio album The Eminem Show (2002). It was released in February 25, 2003, as the fourth single from The Eminem Show. The song uses the chorus and melody of "Dream On" by American rock band Aerosmith.
"Sing for the Moment" received positive reviews from music critics, with many critics praising Eminem's rapping ability, the lyrics, and the "Dream On" sample. "Sing for the Moment" proved to be successful, peaking inside the Top 10 in twenty countries. In the United States, "Sing for the Moment" reached number fourteen on the Billboard Hot 100.
"Sing for the Moment" contains samples of the song "Dream On" by the rock band Aerosmith. Joe Perry plays the guitar solo at the end of the song, and a sample of Steven Tyler singing the chorus of "Dream On" is used as the chorus for this song. Eminem says "sing" when Tyler starts to sing the chorus, and Eminem also says "sing with me" and "come on" in the chorus. Eminem says the words in his live performances as well. The song also contains a sample of "Dream On" at the beginning of the song. "Sing for the Moment" was later released on Eminem's greatest hits compilation album Curtain Call: The Hits (2005).
"Sing for the Moment" deals with the themes of rap music's effect on society and the misunderstanding Eminem claims critics and parents have towards his message. Eminem uses the song to refute critics who have accused him of promoting violence to young people, saying that committing a crime is ultimately up to the offender in a post-9/11 world. He also explains that his music has an advantage for young people, claiming that his music is a relief from boredom and depression. Eminem's altercation with a bouncer named John Guerrera is also referenced in this song. The song reached #14 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Singles Chart, #6 on the UK Singles Chart, and #5 on the Australian ARIAnet Singles Chart.
David Browne cited: "In Sing for the Moment, which includes a tirade against the media and politically motivated prosecutors, the intensity of his delivery overcomes the hoariest of ideas -- incorporating a portion of an overly familiar classic-rock oldie, Aerosmith's Dream On. The song becomes a clarion call of suburban kids everywhere, not just an easy route to a hit."
DX magazine concluded that in this song Eminem is dealing with his life and called it "guitar-fueled track." RapReviews was positive: "'Sing For the Moment' may throw his fans a curveball though: a song which appears to sample Aerosmith's 'Dream On' yet simultaneously features the REAL Joe Perry playing guitar. Obviously not a stretch for the hard rock icons though, who are still remembered for recording 'Walk This Way' with Run-D.M.C. back in the 1980's, so it's an enjoyable diversion from non-stop hardcore hip-hop."
The music video, released in 2003, is a collage created with various clips, including shots from the Anger Management Tour. It also contains cameos by various fellow rappers, including Dr. Dre, the members of D12, 50 Cent and Ludacris. Eminem stands in neutral positions and stares at the camera several times in the video. The video is very similar to the 50 Cent music video "If I Can't". On The Eminem Show, "Sing for the Moment" segues into "Superman". On Curtain Call: The Hits, the segue also fades out as "Superman", since Superman is not included in the compilation. In a clean version of the video, the word "handguns" is omitted from the second verse ("any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns").
