Beta Delphini (Beta Del, β Delphini, β Del) is a binary star in the constellation of Delphinus. The name is a reversal of the latinized name Niccolò Cacciatore assistant to Piazzi, given to designate him as his sussessor as Director of the Palermo Obsrvatory. The name first appeared in Giuseppe Piazzi's Palermo Catalogue, published in 1814. Beta Delphini was found to be a binary star system in 1873 by the American astronomer S. W. Burnham.
In Chinese, 瓠瓜 (Hù Guā), meaning Good Gourd, refers to an asterism consisting of β Delphini, α Delphini, γ2 Delphini, δ Delphini, and ζ Delphini. Consequently, β Delphini itself is known as 瓠瓜二 (Hù Guā-er, English: the Second Star of Good Gourd.).
This system consists of a pair of F-type stars stars that orbit each other with a period of 26.66 years and an eccentricity of 0.36. The plane of the orbit is inclined by an angle of 61° to the line of sight from the Earth. The two stars have an angular separation of about 0.44 arcseconds, making them a challenge to resolve with a telescope. The larger member of the pair is a giant star with 1.75 times the mass and 24 times the luminosity of the Sun, while the secondary component is a subgiant star that has 1.47 times the Sun's mass and around 8 times the Sun's luminosity. The system is around 1.8 billion years old.
