Telfair County is a county located in the U.S. state of Georgia. As of the 2010 census, the population was 16,500. The county seat is McRae.
Archaeologists associated with Atlanta's Fernbank Museum of Natural History have been excavating a 2,000-acre (8.1 km2) plot near McRae, approximately a mile away from the Ocmulgee River. They have found evidence of a Spanish settlement dating back to the first half of the 16th century. The archaeologists suspect that the artifacts originated from a settlement founded by Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón in 1526.
Additional research suggested that the site was one visited by the de Soto Expedition of 1541. They recovered Murano glass beads, which would have been brought for trading with Native Americans; pottery fragments, and iron weapons. Some of the beads bear a chevron pattern, which is believed to be a hallmark of the de Soto expedition, due to the limited timespan in which such beads were produced. Excavations have also produced six metal objects, including three iron tools and a silver pendant. This is further west than scholars had earlier believed that the de Soto expedition had traveled.
Telfair County was established on December 10, 1807, and is named for Edward Telfair, the sixteenth governor of Georgia and a member of the Continental Congress.
The county was originally built up chiefly by Scottish immigrants.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 444 square miles (1,150 km2), of which 437 square miles (1,130 km2) is land and 6.7 square miles (17 km2) (1.5%) is water. The county contains at least 50 artesian wells.
The southern two-thirds of Telfair County, bordered by a line from Milan east to Lumber City, are located in the Lower Ocmulgee River sub-basin of the Altamaha River basin. The northern portion of the county is located in the Little Ocmulgee River sub-basin of the same Altamaha River basin.
