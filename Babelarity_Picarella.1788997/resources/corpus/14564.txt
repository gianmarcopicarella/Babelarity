Sergio Brio (born 19 August 1956) is a former Italian footballer, in the role of centre back, who played for Juventus F.C. in the late 1970s and the 1980s and was part of their European Cup victory in 1985. An atypical continental defender, he was not particularly technically gifted, although he was known for his strength, tenacity, and physicality, as well as his ability in the air, which often made him a goal threat on set pieces; this also allowed him to play as a centre-forward earlier in his career. In addition to his athletic ability, he was also known for his concentration, and was an excellent man-marker, and reader of the game.
Brio was born in Lecce, Apulia. He began his career with his local club, U.S. Lecce, during the 1973–74 season, before moving to Juventus for the 1974–75 season, although he did not make a single appearance with the club that season. He was later sent on loan to Pistoiese from 1975 to 1978, before returning to Juventus. His first season with the Turin club was the 1978–79 season, and he made his Serie A debut with Juventus on 18 March 1979, as they defeated Napoli 1–0. He remained with the club until the 1989–90 season, captaining the club from 1988 to 1990, when he retired from professional football. Overall, he made 378 appearances for Juventus in all competitions, scoring 24 goals, 16 of which came in Serie A over 243 appearances. Brio played for Juventus during one the club's most successful periods, forming a formidable defence alongside Dino Zoff, Gaetano Scirea, Claudio Gentile, and Antonio Cabrini, winning 4 Serie A titles, 3 Italian Cups, a European Cup, a Cup Winners' Cup, an UEFA Cup, a European Super Cup, and an Intercontinental Cup, under managers Giovanni Trapattoni, and subsequently Dino Zoff.
Brio is one of only five players in European football history – with Antonio Cabrini, Gaetano Scirea, Stefano Tacconi and Danny Blind – to have won all international club competitions.
Despite his success at club level, Brio, along with his Juventus defensive team-mate Luciano Favero, never made an appearance for the Italian national side, as manager Enzo Bearzot preferred Fulvio Collovati, for his elegant style of play, and Pietro Vierchowod, for his speed and adeptness at the zonal marking system, in his position. He was a member of Italy's Olympic squad under his former team-mate Dino Zoff during the late 80s.
Following his retirement, he worked as an assistant coach with Juventus under Giovanni Trapattoni, who managed to win the 1992–93 UEFA Cup during his second stint with the club. He has trained recently in Belgium as R.A.E.C. Mons's head coach.
