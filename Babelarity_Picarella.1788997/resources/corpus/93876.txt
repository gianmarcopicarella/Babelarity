The Panorpidae are a family of scorpionflies. This family contains more than 350 species. They are 9â€“25 mm long.
These insects have four membranous wings and threadlike antennae. Their elongated faces terminate with jaws that are used to feed on dead and dying insects, nectar, and rotting fruit. While in larval form, they scavenge by consuming dead insects on the ground.
