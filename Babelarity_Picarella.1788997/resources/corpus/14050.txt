Daring Club Motema Pembe, or DCMP, is a Congolese football club based in Kinshasa.
Created in 1936 under the name Falcon Daring, by the Rev. Father Raphael of Kethulle of Ryhove who was a missionary of the Congregation of Scheutistes. He recruited most of its players among college students Sainte-Anne in Kinshasa (currently Elikya college). The DCMP was renamed CS Imana in 1949 before assuming the name of Daring Club Motema Pembe Imana (Imana DCMP) in 1985. With 29 titles in the national and international level since 1964, the DCMP is currently the most successful club of the DRC.
