The Abakan (Russian: Абака́н), (from the Khakas word for "bear's blood") is a river in the Republic of Khakassia, Russia. It is formed by the confluence of the Bolshoy Abakan and Maly Abakan rivers. It rises in the western Sayan Mountains and flows northeast through the Minusinsk Depression to the Yenisei River. It is about 514 kilometres (319 mi) long (from the Bolshoy Abakan's source), and its drainage basin covers 32,000 square kilometres (12,000 sq mi). The river is used for log driving and irrigation.
The city of Abakan is located at the confluence of the Abakan and the Yenisei.
