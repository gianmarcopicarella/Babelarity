Jay is a town in Santa Rosa County, Florida, United States. The population was 579 at the 2000 census. As of 2004, the population estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau was 650. It is part of the Pensacola–Ferry Pass–Brent Metropolitan Statistical Area.
In 1902, a committee was formed to select a name for the thriving farming community. James Thomas Nowling submitted the name "Pine Level" but it was declined due to a Florida post office already using it. Mr. Nowling was asked to submit a second name and was turned down again due to the name being too long. He was asked to submit yet another name but the Postal Department named the new post office after Mr. Nowling before he was able to submit another name and Mr. Nowling became the first postmaster of Jay.
A small group of farmers began a livestock market in 1940 and reached sales of up to $1 million within 10 years. This industry continues to flourish today.
Oil was discovered here in 1970. The Jay oilfield has approximately 67 oilwells - eleven within the town limits. Royalties from the oil have exceeded $400 million and have enabled us to build a new city hall, fire department and recreation complex.

Jay is a farming community, with cotton, soybeans, peanuts and hay being major crops. Jay is also the site of the giant Jay oil field, which has produced over 330 million barrels since its discovery in 1970, but is now toward the end of its producing life. A small refinery is located off State Road 4. The refinery has had several owners since the 1970s - Exxon sold the refinery to Quantum Resources Management LLC [1] March 2004. In January 2009, Quantum announced that they were ceasing production at the facility due to poor economics, and has terminated roughly half of the plant employees. Quantum resumed production shortly thereafter with oil prices increasing.
