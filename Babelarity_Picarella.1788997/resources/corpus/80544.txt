She finds accommodations with a restaurant ma√Ætre d', Fernando Girasole (Ganz), and soon finds herself enjoying her new life. Meanwhile, her husband has sent a bumbling plumber who has come for the interview to his company, Costantino (Battiston), as a private detective to find her. After meeting and falling in love with Grazia, Rosalba's neighbor across the hall, Costantino calls Rosalba's husband and quits his detective job, claiming that he is unable to find her. However, her husband's mistress Ketty appears and convinces Rosalba to return to her home in Pescara, as Rosalba's son has taken to drugs during her absence. Considering the vitality of her return to her duties, she abandons her Venice life and returns home to her family. Fernando follows her and persuades her to return to Venice with him. Rosalba realizes her love for Fernando and returns with him to Venice. The movie ends with all the characters dancing gaily for a surreal music in the stunning moonlight.
