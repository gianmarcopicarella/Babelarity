Germany competed at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, People's Republic of China. A total of 439 athletes were nominated to participate in the Games. The German National Olympic Committee (DOSB) nominated athletes on 29 May, 23 June and 15 July 2008. Reaching the qualification standard set by the relevant sport's international governing body did not automatically mean that the athlete was nominated for Beijing, as the DOSB had stricter qualification standards. An athlete needed to have a somewhat realistic chance for a top 12 position. An exception to this are the team events, as the number of competing teams is already very limited through the IOC standards, and a chance for a respective place is already given by the qualification.

After the Grand Prix, the score of each individual rider is cleared, meaning only the scores of the Grand Prix Special and the Grand Prix Freestyle add up to the final score and are relevant for the rank of a rider in the individual competition. Only the 15 best riders of the Grand Prix Special advance to the Freestyle.
# - Indicates that points do not count in team total
Only a certain amount of individual riders are allowed to advance to the final and of one nation, maximal three individual riders can advance. The riders who did not advance to the individual final are ranked after all of the riders who did, their final rank being determined by their total penalties gained in the competition up to that point (dressage, cross-country and jumping qualifier).
After the team qualifier, the penalty score of each team is cleared, so that only the penalties of the two rounds of the team final, which are added up and together amount to the final score of a team, are relevant for the final rank. Likewise, every individual rider goes into the individual final without any penalties, for the penalties of all three individual qualifiers are deleted beforehand. In determining a rider's rank in the individual competition, only the penalties of both round of the individual final, which together amount to the final score of a rider, are relevant.
Only a certain amount of individual riders are allowed to advance to the individual final and of one nation maximal three individual riders can advance. The riders who did not advance to the individual final are ranked after all of the riders who did, their final rank being determined by their total penalties gained in the individual qualifiers. Likewise, if a jump-off is required, every rider starts with a clear score, not taking previous penalties with him or her. The rider with the fewest penalties in the fastest time wins the jump-off.
