Roger Federer was the defending champion, but lost in the quarterfinals to Robin Söderling, which allowed the Swede to make a second successive final here. This was the first time since the 2004 French Open that Federer did not reach the semifinals of a Grand Slam tournament, and the only Grand Slam since the 2004 French Open to not feature either Federer or Novak Djokovic in the semifinals (as of July 2016).
Rafael Nadal won his fifth French Open title by defeating Söderling in the final, 6–4, 6–2, 6–4. Nadal finished the tournament without having dropped a set for the second time (the first time was in 2008). This let Nadal regain the world no. 1 ranking for the first time since July 2009.
