In Henan province, China, during the Ming Dynasty, a severe frost in the spring destroys the winter wheat crop. Torrential rains in mid summer cause massive flooding of farmland and villages (by some accounts submerged in a metre of water).

This follows a series of natural disasters in Henan in the years 1528, 1531, 1539, and 1545.
