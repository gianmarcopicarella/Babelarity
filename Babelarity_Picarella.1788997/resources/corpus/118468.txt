255 Oppavia is a sizeable Main belt asteroid. It classified as a dark P-type asteroid.
It was discovered by Johann Palisa on March 31, 1886 in Vienna and was named after Opava, town in the Czech Republic (then part of Austria-Hungary), where Palisa was born.
Oppavia was long thought to be a member of the now defunct Ceres asteroid family, but was found to be an unrelated interloper on the basis of its non-matching spectral type.
