The Men's 105 kg weightlifting event at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom, took place at ExCeL London.
Total score was the sum of the lifter's best result in each of the snatch and the clean and jerk, with three lifts allowed for each lift. In case of a tie, the lighter lifter won; if still tied, the lifter who took the fewest attempts to achieve the total score won. Lifters without a valid snatch score did not perform the clean and jerk.
Russia's Khadzhimurat Akkayev and Dmitry Klokov were on the start list but did not compete.
