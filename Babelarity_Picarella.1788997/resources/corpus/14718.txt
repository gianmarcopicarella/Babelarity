Markus Pröll (born 28 August 1979 in Rheinbach) is a German former football goalkeeper. During his career, he played for 1. FC Köln and Eintracht Frankfurt in Germany and Panionios F.C. in Greece.
He started his professional career with 1. FC Köln before moving to Frankfurt for the 2003–04 season.
He was elected by the German football magazine kicker as the Bundesliga's best goalkeeper of the first half of the 2006–07 season. Unfortunately he hardly could contend this title as he suffered of many injuries.
At the beginning of his career, Pröll became a target of some ridicule because his name "Pröll" literally means something like "lout" in German.
