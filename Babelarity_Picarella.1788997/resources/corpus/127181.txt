Le Fleix is a commune in the Dordogne department in Aquitaine in southwestern France.
Le Fleix lies on the banks of the Dordogne River at a place where the river bends. This is likely the origin of the name "flexus".
Le Fleix is famous for the Treaty of Fleix, signed there in 1580.
There were once two castles in Le Fleix, the Old Castle, which was destroyed, and the New Castle built in the 17th century as a residence for Frédéric de Foix. It was sold during the French Revolution, and became a Protestant church in 1805.
The harbour is active in the timber and wine trades. The economy, once based on the river, is now primarily viticultural.
