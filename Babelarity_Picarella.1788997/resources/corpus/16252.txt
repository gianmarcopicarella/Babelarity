Approximately 5,000 athletes from 42 nations participated at the games. The competition was marred by a total of 7 positive drug tests.
Financially, the 1999 games were a success, generating a surplus of $8.9 million through a combination of fiscal restraint  and the contribution of nearly 20,000 volunteers.
The 1999 Pan American Games were the second Pan American Games hosted by Canada and Winnipeg. Previously, Winnipeg hosted the 1967 Pan American Games.
