The first settler was Edway Stoughton. Charles Parks settled the land that is now the village of Cannon Falls in July 1854. Cannon Falls village proper was laid out by Richard and William Freeborn and was platted in 1855 by county surveyor S. A. Hart. The village was incorporated March 10, 1857. A post office was established as Cannon River Falls in 1855, and the name of the post office was shortened to Cannon Falls in 1889. Cannon Falls was reincorporated as a city in 1905.
An abundance of water power from both the big Cannon River and the Little Cannon River attracted manufacturers and capital investment. The first flouring mill was built by R. C. Knox & Co., in 1957. Other manufacturers, such as a wool mill, a grist mill and a mill producing syrup from amber cane, used power generated from the Little Cannon River starting in 1861.
