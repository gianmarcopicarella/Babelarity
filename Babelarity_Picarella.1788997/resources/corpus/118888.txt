Delta Draconis (δ Dra, δ Draconis) is a yellow star in the constellation Draco. It has the traditional names Aldib, Altais (the goat) and Nodus Secundus. This star has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.0, making it easily visible to the naked eye. Parallax measurements with the Hipparcos satellite yield a distance estimate of 97.4 light-years (29.9 parsecs) from Earth.
Delta Draconis is a giant star with a stellar classification of G9 III. This indicates that, at an estimated age of 800 million years, this star has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core and entered a later stage in its evolution. The angular diameter of the star is estimated as 3.37 ± 0.06 mas. At a parallax of 32.54 mas, this corresponds to a physical radius equal to 11 times the solar radius. It is radiating 59 times the luminosity of the Sun from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 4,820 K. At this temperature, it is giving off the yellow-hued glow of a G-type star. With a mass 2.32 times that of the Sun, this star will end its life as a white dwarf.
The title Altais was derived from Arabic Al Tāis, "the Goat", the association of this star, along with π Dra, ρ Dra and ε Dra (Tyl). According to the catalogue of stars in the Technical Memorandum 33-507 - A Reduced Star Catalog Containing 537 Named Stars, Al Tāis or Tais were the title for three stars :δ Dra as Altais, π Dra as Tais I and ρ Dra as Tais II (exclude ε Dra).
In Chinese, 天廚 (Tiān Chú, Tien Choo), meaning Celestial Kitchen or Heaven's Kitchen, refers to an asterism consisting of δ Draconis, σ Draconis, ε Draconis, ρ Draconis, 64 Draconis and π Draconis. Consequently, δ Draconis itself is known as 天廚一 (Tiān Chú yī, English: the First Star of Celestial Kitchen.)
Delta Draconis is the northern pole star of Ceres, lying 1.5 degrees from the true pole.
