Charlie Will Bell III (born March 12, 1979) is a retired American professional basketball player.
He began playing basketball at Flint Southwestern Academy High School, and had an excellent college career at Michigan State, appearing in three NCAA Final Fours, and being named Michigan State Defensive Player of the Year in each of the four years he played. He went undrafted, but was signed by the Phoenix Suns on July 23, 2001 as a free agent and played five games for them. After being released by the Suns, he signed with the Phoenix Eclipse of the ABA and played four games for them. He initially signed a 10-day contract with the Dallas Mavericks on January 10, 2002, and was then signed for the remainder of the season on January 15, but only appeared in two games.
After a rather brief stint in the NBA, Bell took his career to Europe to play in the Italian and Spanish Leagues where he was regarded as a superstar. In March 2002, he signed with Benetton Treviso of the Italian League and won the Italian League with Treviso. In the 2002–03 season, he played for Virtus (Kinder) Bologna, but was injured in December 2002 and was sidelined for most of the season. In August 2003, he signed with Mabo Livorno also of the Italian League. In July 2004, he signed with Leche Rio Breogan Lugo of the Spanish League and was named to the Spanish League first-team for the 2004–05 season. He was also the top scorer and four times player of the month. He became a local hero and a legend while playing in Breogán.
Bell signed with the Milwaukee Bucks for the 2005–06 season, and on March 28, 2006, had his best performance since entering the league, recording his first career triple-double in the Bucks' 132–110 win over the Suns. Bell had then-career highs of 19 points, 13 assists, and 10 rebounds to lead Milwaukee. Bell, who played only seven games in his other NBA season in 2001–02, appeared in 59 games (starting in six) for the Bucks in the 2005–2006 regular season, and finished with averages of 8.4 points, 2.2 assists, and 2.0 rebounds in 21.7 minutes per game. He improved those numbers the following season, to 13 points, 3 rebounds and 3 assists per games in 35 minutes on average, while appearing in all 82 games.
On September 17, 2007, being a restricted free agent, Bell signed an offer sheet from the Miami Heat worth $18,500,000 over 5 years. Although he stated that he did not want to play for Milwaukee, they decided to match the offer 3 days later.
On June 22, 2010, Bell, along with Dan Gadzuric, was traded to the Golden State Warriors for Corey Maggette. He was waived by the Warriors under the amnesty clause prior to the 2011–12 NBA season.
In January 2012 he signed with Pepsi Caserta.
Bell stars in a popular series of webisodes titled "Hey Charlie, Do My Job!" in which he takes up a fan's occupation (e.g. working at Wendy's, or being an interior decorator) for a day as well as a filament winder at Amalga Composites, Inc. See page 884.
