Židikai (Samogitian: Žėdėkā) is a village in Mažeikiai district municipality, Lithuania. It is located 21 km west of Mažeikiai. Židikai is the centre of Židikai elderate. Židikai's Jewish community perished in World War II. However, the village progressed during the Soviet era and is regarded as an urban monument. It is known for being the home of Marija Pečkauskaitė – Šatrijos Ragana, a famous Lithuanian writer (1877 - 1930).
Židikai originates from the words Žydi kaip laukas, or from the word Židikis (meaning tough). Židikai was first mentioned in historic records in 1568 AD.
From 1614, Židikai was held by the Kražiai Jesuits. In 1659, during the Northern Wars, Swedish forces burnt down Židikai.
Between 1918 and 1939, when Lithuania was established as an independent state, Židikai prospered. It was a parish centre, a service centre and a centre of governance. Židikai's population in the interwar period was nearly 1000.
During World War II, Židikai lost many inhabitants: the community of the Židikai Jewish shtetl (tiny village) was destroyed during the Holocaust. Economic activity in the village stalled. After the war, during the years of Soviet occupation, Židikai developed similarly to other small villages of Lithuania: in 1952, a hospital was established in a former parsonage; in 1954, a secondary school was added to the primary school; and in 1956, Židikai's House of Culture was founded. Židikai's population in 1959 was 429.
After the re-establishment of Lithuania in 1990, Židikai became centre of the Židikai elderate.
The village hosts three grocery shops, a secondary school, dispensary, library, music school and a cultural centre. Parks were created in 2006 and 2008. In 2007, the President of the Republic of Lithuania approved a new coat of arms for Židikai. On 30 April 2010, a project to renovate the centre of the village began. It was financed by the EU and Mažeikiai District Municipality funds. During the project, the Nepriklausomybės and Turgaus squares as well as the buildings of the cultural centre and Židikai elderate were renovated. Project was finished in 2012. Its value was LTL 731.677. The old town of Židikai is an urban monument with its street plan protected. The large Lithuanian company, ORLEN Lietuva has a presence in the Židikai eldership.
Židikai village has a radial layout, established from the time of the Wallach land reform of 1547. Conserved buildings are predominantly one or two floors high and date to the early 20th century. There are also post war and later 20th century buildings.
Židikai is noted for its resident of 15 years, the author Šatrijos Ragana. In the centre of Židikai, there is a museum dedicated to her memory. Its exhibits document both her childhood and youth and her later life in the village.
A cultural centre encourages regional traditions and leisure activities for the youth and other residents of the village. The building of the Centre of Culture was completed in 1967 with two rooms: a larger room with a capacity of 200 seats for large events, concerts, disco parties and so on and a smaller room for events such as art exhibitions and board game tournaments.
The Židikai public library opened in 1939. In 2004, the library had about 9000 documents and books in its holdings. In 1994, the library moved to new premises in the Centre of Culture building. The library is a branch of Mažeikiai public library.
Židikai is the centre of Židikai eldership and the largest town within the eldership. The area of the eldership is 198 km2 (76.45 sq mi). The population density of the eldeship is 3.044-man/km². In 2009, five sub-elderships were established, one of which was located in Židikai village.
