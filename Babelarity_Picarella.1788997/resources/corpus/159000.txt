Orzysz [ˈɔʐɨʂ] (German: Arys, Lithuanian: Arys) is a town in Pisz County, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, Poland, with 7,512 inhabitants (2007). It is located on Orzysz Lake.
Until 1702, all church services in Orzysz were conducted in Polish. In 1834, according to the Prussian church census, there were 600 Poles and 502 Germans in the town parish. The census counted anyone who knew some German as German. The population of Orzysz slowly increased: there were 918 inhabitants in 1801, 1107 in 1846, 2201 in 1910 and 3543 in 1939.
Before 1945 the area was part of Germany (East Prussia). After World War II the region was placed under Polish administration and ethnically cleansed according to the post-war Potsdam Agreement. The native German populace was expelled and replaced with Poles.
