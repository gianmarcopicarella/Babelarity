The East Prussia Panzer Unit (Panzerverband Ostpreu√üen) was an ad hoc combined arms unit created for operations out of East Prussia during the Invasion of Poland in 1939. It was generally called Panzer Division Kempf after General Werner Kempf assumed command, though it was only about half the strength of the other panzer divisions of the time.
