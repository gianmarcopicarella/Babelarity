Before Kearney was named Kearney, it was called Dobytown and it was located 2 miles (3.2 km) southeast of the present-day Kearney. Later the city was moved and renamed after the nearby Fort Kearny (with an extra "e" added, but pronounced the same), a United States Army outpost along the Oregon Trail in the middle 19th century. The fort was named after Col. and later General Stephen W. Kearny. The "e" was added by mistake sometime afterwards by postmen who consistently misspelled the town name. Eventually it just stuck. The current location of the city is on the North side of the Platte River and steadily grew as a result of the influence of the railroad.
In 1912, a Catholic Diocese was centered here. This status was removed in 1917, with the creation of other dioceses. In 1997, the city began to be used as a titular see by the Catholic Church.

Dexter (season 6), episode 7 ("Nebraska", airdate November 13, 2011) was set in Kearney, Nebraska, in large part because the show's co-executive producer, Tim Schlattmann, is a 1981 Kearney High School graduate. In "Nebraska", whose departure in multiple ways from previous Dexter episodes was (for the most part) favorably received, witness protection has relocated the Trinity Killer's surviving family to Kearney, where a copycat killer appears to have murdered Trinity's widow and daughter, so Dexter travels to Kearney to avenge the killings. Numerous elements in the episode underscore Kearney's rural setting and culture, some sinister, and farm-specific settings and implements add variety to Dexter's methods of killing and corpse disposal.
