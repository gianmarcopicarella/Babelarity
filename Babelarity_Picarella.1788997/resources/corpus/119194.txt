1988 Delores, provisional designation 1952 SV, is a stony asteroid and slow rotator from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, about 5 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by the Indiana Asteroid Program at the U.S. Goethe Link Observatory near Brooklyn, Indiana on 28 September 28, 1952.
The S-type asteroid is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.9â€“2.4 AU once every 3 years and 2 months (1,155 days). Its orbit is tilted by 4 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic and shows an eccentricity of 0.10. It has a long rotation period of 88 hours. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL) assumes an albedo of 0.24, a typical value for stony asteroids.
It was named after Delores Owings, collaborator of Tom Gehrels and supervisor of position measurements on photographic plates in the minor planet program of Indiana University. The naming was proposed by the Director of the Minor Planet Center, Paul Herget.
