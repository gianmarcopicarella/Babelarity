Susana is the daughter of María Luisa Sanders, and Augusto "Johnny" Giménez Aubert. She had a hard childhood, tinted by her parents' separation. She studied in Quilmes, and graduated from La Anunciata Collegiate as a primary teacher, a profession she never practised. In 1962 (at 17 yrs. old) she married businessman Mario Sarabayrouse. A year later she gave birth to her only daughter, Mercedes Sarrabayrouse. She has two grandchildren, Lucía and Manuel.
In 1998 had to pay $10 million to her then-husband Huberto Roviralta as a divorce settlement.
Before becoming famous, for a couple of years Susana worked as an executive secretary for a large factory, but realizing that she needed a more exciting career at 19 yrs. old she decided to follow the steps of the fashion world and became a model. In a short time she became well known for her TV commercial for Cadum, a brand of French soap, and that was the beginning of her stardom. In private her family and friends call her "Su", and as such her fans started to call her "Su" Giménez!
