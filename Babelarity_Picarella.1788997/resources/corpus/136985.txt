The Absence is an American melodic death metal band from Tampa, Florida. Their style has been described as aggressive thrash metal with Scandinavian metal influences. They were previously signed to Metal Blade Records.
The band released an eponymous EP in 2004 entitled, The Absence, and followed up with their debut album, From Your Grave, in 2005. The band's second album, Riders of the Plague, was released in 2007. The album was praised in a review for finding an "interesting balance" between the genres death metal and thrash metal. In 2007, bassist Micheal Leon joined the band. Drummer Jeramie Kling left the band that same year and was temporarily replaced by drummer Chris Pistillo from the Tampa death metal scene. The band recruited Justin Reynolds as their new drummer in early 2008.
The Absence stated in late 2008 that they would be entering the studio to record a new album in March 2009. Due to time constraints and touring duties, the band said they would enter the studio on September 10 since the original date "wasn't the right time." The band delayed the recording of the album again and later entered Mana Recording Studios on November 2, 2009 to record Enemy Unbound. Their third studio album, Enemy Unbound was released on September 14, 2010. Jeramie Kling rejoined the band during summer 2010. On September 27, 2010, The Absence released their music video of "Enemy Unbound" from their eponymous album Enemy Unbound. As of January 1, 2013 guitarist Peter Joseph parted ways with The Absence. On the 22nd of January 2013 it was announced that Per Nilsson of Scar Symmetry had joined the band.
On July 25, 2015 guitarist Patrick Scott Pintavalle announced on Facebook that he had left the band.
