945 Barcelona is a minor planet orbiting the Sun in the Asteroid belt. It was discovered 3 February 1921 from Barcelona by the Catalan astronomer Josep Comas Solá (1868–1937) and named for the city of Barcelona (Catalonia), the birthplace of the discoverer. It has an estimated diameter of 25.5 km.
This object is the namesake of a family of 91–600 asteroids that share similar spectral properties and orbital elements; hence they may have arisen from the same collisional event. All members have a relatively high orbital inclination.
