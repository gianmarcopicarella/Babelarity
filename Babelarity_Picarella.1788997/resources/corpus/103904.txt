Gimhae International Airport (formerly Kimhae International Airport) (IATA: PUS, ICAO: RKPK) is located on the western end of Busan, South Korea. It opened in 1976. A new international terminal opened on October 31, 2007. Gimhae International Airport is the main hub for Air Busan. Runway 18L/36R is used for military purposes only for Gimhae Air Base, but due to increasing traffic, there are plans to open the runway for airliners. In 2015, 12,382,150 passengers used the airport.
Around 2013, Busan had announced that it was proposing to cease Gimhae International Airport's operation on all passenger planes, due to the small size, small maximum amounts of space and sky-routes, and safety. They plan to move Busan's airport to the island of Gadeokdo (south sector of Busan New Port), an island in southwestern Busan and 'Busan New Port' in South 7 km.
In 2015, the ten carriers with the largest percentage of passengers flying into, out of, or through Gimhae International Airport are as follows:
