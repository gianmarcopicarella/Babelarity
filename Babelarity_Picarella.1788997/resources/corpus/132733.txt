Ad Petri cathedram ("To the Chair of Peter") was the first encyclical issued by Pope John XXIII on 29 June 1959. It was promulgated eight months into the pontificate and addresses truth, unity and peace. It was neither a trend-setting social document or doctrinal exposition, but instead a fatherly message which was seen as addressing its issues with warmth and concern.
