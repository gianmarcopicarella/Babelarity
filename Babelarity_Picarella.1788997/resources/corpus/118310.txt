At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Theodosius and Valentinianus (or, less frequently, year 1178 Ab urbe condita). The denomination 425 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
