Hardin County is a county located in the U.S. state of Illinois. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 4,320, making it the least populous county in Illinois. Its county seat is Elizabethtown. Hardin County is located in the part of the state known as Little Egypt.
Hardin County was formed in 1839 from Pope County. Additional area was later added from Gallatin County. Hardin County was named for Hardin County, Kentucky, which was named in honor of Colonel John Hardin, an officer in the Revolutionary War and the Northwest Indian War. Hardin was murdered by Shawnee Indians while he was on a peace mission in 1792 for President George Washington, in what is now Shelby County, Ohio. In the 1790s and early 1800s, the Hardin County area, especially Cave-In-Rock, was notorious as a stronghold used by outlaws, bandits, river pirates, and counterfeiters.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 182 square miles (470 km2), of which 178 square miles (460 km2) is land and 4.1 square miles (11 km2) (2.2%) is water. It is the second-smallest county in Illinois by area.
Hicks Dome (37.53139°N 88.36833°W﻿ / 37.53139; -88.36833) is an interesting geological feature in Hardin County. Some believe the dome may be related to an ancient meteor or comet impact, part of the 38th parallel structures, which are a string of geological features running west to Kansas. This is thought to be a string of impact craters from a celestial body that broke apart before striking the earth. However, the Hicks Dome is underlain by ultramafic igneous rocks and igneous diatremes or breccia pipes. Most geologists now accept the theory that the older rocks at the center of the uplift are a result of this deep seated igneous activity. This activity may also have provided the fluorine in the fluorspar deposits in the region. Fluorspar, or calcium fluoride, was mined in Hardin County until the early 1990s.
