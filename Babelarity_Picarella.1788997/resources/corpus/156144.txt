Annweiler am Trifels (  ), or Annweiler is a town in the Südliche Weinstraße district, in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It is situated on the river Queich, 12 km west of Landau, and on the railway from Landau to Pirmasens.
Annweiler is situated in the Southern part of the Palatinate forest called the Wasgau, and is surrounded by high hills which yield a famous red sandstone. The town's main industry is tourism. On the Sonnenberg (493 m) lie the ruins of the castle of Trifels, in which Richard Coeur de Lion was imprisoned from 31 March to 19 April 1193.
Annweiler is the seat of the Verbandsgemeinde ("collective municipality") of Annweiler am Trifels.
In an 1911 edition of the Brockhaus Enzyklopädie, the area around Annweiler was referred to as "Pfälzer Schweiz".
