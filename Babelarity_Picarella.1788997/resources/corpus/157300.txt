Djurö National Park is a Swedish national park consisting of the Djurö Archipelago, a group of about 30 islands in Sweden's biggest lake, Vänern. Established in 1991, it has an area of 24 km2 (9.3 sq mi).
The islands are presently uninhabited, but there is a hunting lodge and an unmanned lighthouse. Wildlife includes fallow deer and a great variety of birds including ospreys, hobby, oystercatchers and great black-backed gulls. The horizon of Djurö consists only of water, except in southern direction where Kinnekulle is visible.
Visitors to Djurö are advised to rent a boat since there is no regular ferry to the islands.
