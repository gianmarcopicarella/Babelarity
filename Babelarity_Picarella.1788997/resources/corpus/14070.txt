The 1961 Italian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 10 September 1961 at Monza.
The race was marked by one of the most terrible accidents in the history of Formula One, when on the end of lap 2 at the approach to the Parabolica the German driver Wolfgang von Trips lost control of his Ferrari and crashed into a stand full of spectators, killing 15 and himself. The race was not stopped, allegedly to assist the rescue work for the injured. This was also the last Formula One race ever to be held on the full 10 km (6.213 mi) Monza circuit, with the 2 bankings and the straight between the bankings included.
The race was won by von Trips' American team mate Phil Hill, who – since the German was the only one who could challenge him – thus won the World Championship with one race to go.
Lap Leaders: Phil Hill 36 laps (1-3, 5, 7, 10, 14-43); Richie Ginther 7 laps (4, 6, 8-9, 11-13).
Phil Hill scored his 3rd and final victory in Formula One.
Having passed von Trips' points total, Phil Hill won the world championship with a race left to go.
