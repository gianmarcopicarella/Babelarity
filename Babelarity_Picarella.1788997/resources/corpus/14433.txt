Georges Leekens (born 18 May 1949) is a Belgian football coach who is currently in charge of Lokeren in the Belgian Pro League.
Leekens was first selected as national coach after impressive work at R.E. Mouscron. In his first spell as coach of the Belgium national football team he led it to the 1998 FIFA World Cup finals after a two-legged win against the Republic of Ireland in the qualifying play-off. He was sacked from his role as federal coach after a disappointing 3rd place in the World Cup group stage failed to qualify Belgium for the second round.
On 29 May 2009 he signed a three-year deal with Kortrijk.
On 11 May 2010 Leekens signed a contract until 2012 to take over the Belgium national team for the second time. As a consequence he had to resign from his coaching role at K.V. Kortrijk.
On 12 April 2011 it was announced that Leekens's contract had been extended to 2014 after some promising results in the Euro 2012 qualifying campaign. On 13 May 2012 it was announced that Leekens will coach Club Brugge for a second time, but he was fired a few months later after a series of successive defeats.
Georges Leekens is the cousin of Louis Leekens, who was Belgian National Champion of gymnastics in 1966 and is currently leading the top sports school for gymnastics in Genk.
