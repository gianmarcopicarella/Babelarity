The Franklin County Industrial Building Authority, one of only 7 created by a Georgia constitutional amendment, actively seeks and recruits new industries to the county. The Authority consists of seven members: each of the 5 mayors from the cities within Franklin County, and two at-large members selected by the Board of Commissioners.
