Eric Augustus "Sleepy" Floyd (born March 6, 1960) is an American retired professional basketball player.
Born in Gastonia, North Carolina, Floyd received the nickname "Sleepy" playing baseball in the fourth grade, when a spectator yelled "Get that kid out of the game. He’s sleeping." A 6'3" guard, Floyd played competitively at Hunter Huss High School in Gastonia. During Floyd's junior season at Hunter Huss High, he led his team to win in the 1977 North Carolina state basketball championship over rival Ashbrook High, a team lead by James Worthy.

Two seasons later, he averaged 18.8 points and 10.3 assists and earned a spot on the 1987 NBA All-Star Team.
In December 1987, Floyd was traded with Joe Barry Carroll to the Houston Rockets for Ralph Sampson and Steve Harris, and Floyd would play 5½ seasons with the Rockets before signing as a free agent with the San Antonio Spurs in 1993, a year before the Rockets would win their 2 consecutive championships.

Floyd scored 12 consecutive field goals in the fourth quarter, finishing the game with 51 points, and prevented a sweep of the Warriors by in-state rival Lakers.
