Dusit Zoo (Thai: สวนสัตว์ดุสิต) is a zoo in Bangkok, Thailand. Located at Khao Din Park in Bangkok's Dusit District next to the Parliament House and Dusit Palace, it is the oldest zoo of Thailand, built by King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) as his private garden adjacent to the royal palace. After the king's death, the garden was left unattended for years.
In 1938, the revolutionary government asked King Rama VIII's regency to give this park to Bangkok City Municipality to be open as a public zoo. The King donated deer and a number of other animals from the palace for public exhibition. The City of Bangkok operated the zoo until 1954. Since then it has been transferred to the state Zoological Park Organization, which also operates Khao Khiao Open Zoo, Chiang Mai Zoo, Songkhla Zoo and Nakhon Ratchasima Zoo. Dusit Zoo or "Khao Din", spans a total area of 188, 800 square meters, and is regarded as the most popular zoo in Thailand, attracting approximately 2.5 million visitors annually.
Dusit Zoo is located in the heart of Bangkok, with over 1600 species of domestic and international animals, including:
331 mammals
170 reptiles
849 birds
Dusit Zoo is home to a variety of animals, ranging from monkeys, alligators, kangaroos, and zebras, to penguins, elephants, camels, and giraffes. The Albino barking deer and white Bengal tiger are also rare highlights at the zoo. Play Land offers rides and amusement facilities to entertain children throughout the day, while boat peddling and the sightseeing train provide different modes of exploration. Dusit Zoo also contains an animal hospital, zoo museum, and educational centre.
