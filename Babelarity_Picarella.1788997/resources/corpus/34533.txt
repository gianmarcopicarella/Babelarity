Eranthemum pulchellum (Eranthemum nervosum, English: blue eranthemum, or blue sage) is a strongly branched shrub, popular with gardeners in tropical India and China because of the spikes of flowers that are bright gentian blue - an unusual color in the tropics. The flowers appear from green-and-white veined bracts that remain after the blooms fall, forming a column several inches long. The hairy leaves are large and dark green. A sprawling shrub which may reach a metre or more in height, E. pulchellum is usually kept lower and bushier through pruning. Light shade is preferred in a garden; in a greenhouse it needs warm conditions. It is easily propagated from cuttings. According to ITIS, Eranthemum pulchellum is the only species in the genus Eranthemum although The Plant List accepts 22 species.
