Anna Henrietta Bergendahl (born 11 December 1991) is a Swedish singer. She was born in Hägersten, Stockholm and raised in Nyköping and Katrineholm. Bergendahl is of partial Irish descent as her grandmother was born and lives in Ireland, and Anna's first performance in front of an audience was made in a cathedral in York when she was only eight years old. She took part in Swedish TV4 music program Super Troupers in 2004, and in Idol 2008 where she reached the Final 5 before being eliminated.
In 2009, Bergendahl signed for Lionheart Records. Her debut album was released on 14 April 2010. Bergendahl won Melodifestivalen 2010 with the song "This Is My Life" and represented Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 in Norway, where she became the first and only Swedish entrant in the Contest's history to fail to qualify for the final. The song hit No. 1 on the Swedish Singles Chart on 5 March 2010.
Bergendahl successfully applied for the TV4 talent show Idol 2008 with her rendition of Bonnie Raitt's Have a Heart which received praises from the jury which consisted of Laila Bagge, Anders Bagge and Andreas Carlsson. She later sang songs like ABBA's Mamma Mia, Py Bäckman's Stad i ljus, Save Up All Your Tears, Bleeding Love by Leona Lewis, The Best and Over the Rainbow.
Bergendahl finished fifth in the Idol season which was later won by Kevin Borg.
In 2009 Bergendahl was approached by Kristian Lagerström and Bobby Ljunggren and asked if she wanted to record a song for Melodifestivalen 2010.
Anna Bergendahl participated in Melodifestivalen 2010 with the song "This Is My Life", written and produced by Kristian Lagerström (lyrics) and Bobby Ljunggren (music). The song won the final in Ericsson Globe on 13 March 2010, with 214 points. Bergendahl represented Sweden at the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 in Oslo, Norway, where she became the first Swedish singer not to qualify for the final since the introduction of the semifinals in 2004 (although she placed 11th, just outside the top 10 qualifiers by a margin of 5 points). "This Is My Life'" was the first ballad to win Melodifestivalen since 1998 when Kärleken är won and was also Sweden's 50th entry in the Eurovision Song Contest.
After Eurovision Bergendahl participated in Allsång på Skansen, Sommarkrysset, and Lotta på Liseberg. She also went on a tour and sang songs from her debut album. In 2012 Bergendahl released her new album Something to Believe In with the debut single from the new album being "Live and Let Go".
