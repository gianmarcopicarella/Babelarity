The Norian is a division of the Triassic geological period. It has the rank of an age (geochronology) or stage (chronostratigraphy). The Norian lasted from ~228 to ~208.5 million years ago. It was preceded by the Carnian and succeeded by the Rhaetian.
The Norian was named after the Noric Alps in Austria. The stage was introduced into scientific literature by Austrian geologist Edmund Mojsisovics von Mojsvar in 1869.
The Norian stage begins at the base of the ammonite biozones of Klamathites macrolobatus and Stikinoceras kerri, and at the base of the conodont biozones of Metapolygnathus communisti and Metapolygnathus primitius. A global reference profile for the base (a GSSP) had in 2009 not yet been appointed.
The top of the Norian (the base of the Rhaetian) is at the first appearance of ammonite species Cochloceras amoenum. The base of the Rheatian is also close to the first appearance of conodont species Misikella spp. and Epigondolella mosheri and the radiolarid species Proparvicingula moniliformis.
In the Tethys domain, the Norian stage contains six ammonite biozones:
zone of Halorites macer
zone of Himavatites hogarti
zone of Cyrtopleurites bicrenatus
zone of Juvavites magnus
zone of Malayites paulckei
zone of Guembelites jandianus
Synapsids
Aetosaurs
Dicynodonts
Phytosaurs
Acanthinites
