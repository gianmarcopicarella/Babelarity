Gothic Kabbalah is the thirteenth full-length musical album by Therion. It was released in Europe on 12 January 2007. This album was mixed by Stefan Glaumann who already contributed to bands such as Rammstein, Evergrey, Europe and Def Leppard. The main line-up has been slightly changed since previous studio albums (Lemuria and Sirius B). Petter Karlsson returned to play drums, having already played with the band during Lemuria / Sirius B tour during the period of 2004–2006. Since Christofer Johnsson announced in 2006 he is retiring from singing, vocals on Gothic Kabbalah were performed by Mats Levén, as well as Snowy Shaw and three female singers: Katarina Lilja, Anna Nyhlin and Hannah Holgersson.
The album is based on concepts from the life of 17th-century esoteric scholar Johannes Bureus.
