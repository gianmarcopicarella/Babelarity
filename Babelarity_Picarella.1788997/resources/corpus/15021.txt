Stabæk Fotball is a Norwegian association football club based in Bærum, and a section of the multi-sport organization Stabæk IF. Founded in 1912, the club’s name is an archaic spelling of the suburban area Stabekk, from which it once originated. Their home stadium is the Nadderud Stadion after a three-year-long stay at the Telenor Arena. Their current chairman is Espen Moe.
After years of lean seasons, they won their first title in 1998 as they emerged victorious in the Norwegian Cup, beating Rosenborg BK 3–1 in the final. After having been relegated to Adeccoligaen after a poor 2004 season, they experienced a successful period under new manager Jan Jönsson, during which they returned to the league in 2005, won the 2008 Norwegian Premier League, their first, and reached the final of the Norwegian Cup, culminating in a very successful 2008 season for the club. Stabæk subsequently won the 2009 Norwegian Community Shield but finished a disappointing 12th and 10th place in the 2010 and 2011 league seasons, respectively, thus narrowly avoiding relegation both times.
Stabæk holds longstanding rivalries with Bærum SK, FK Lyn and Vålerenga, both in the league and by geographical location. The team’s home colors, entirely blue, have earned them the nickname “De Blaa” (The Blue Ones). In 2009, Stabæk became the first Norwegian association football club with both their men's and women’s teams in the premier divisions. Lillestrøm followed suit the next year.
On 30 November 2015, Billy McKinlay was appointed as manager of the club on a two-year contract. McKinlay resigned as manager on 8 July 2016, after being knocked out of the UEFA Europa League by Connah's Quay Nomads.
Stabæk played home games at the Nadderud Stadion until 2008. They then moved into the Telenor Arena, which had a capacity of 15,000 people. But their stay at the Telenor Arena became shorter than desired, and after a three-year-long stay at the indoor arena, they moved back to the Nadderud Stadion due to economical problems with the new arena. The women's team, Stabæk FK, currently also plays home games at the Nadderud Stadion. The Nadderud Stadion has a capacity of 7,000 spectators.
On 4 February 2010, Einar Schultz was elected chairman of Stabæk, replacing Ingebrigt Steen Jensen. Schultz has held various positions in the Stabæk system over the last five years. In February 2012, Kjell Johnsen was elected the new chairman of Stabæk Fotball. Johnsen was replaced in 2013 by Espen Moe.
