Königsberg in Bayern is a town in the Haßberge district, in Lower Franconia, Bavaria, Germany. It is situated 7 km northeast of Haßfurt, and 31 km northwest of Bamberg.
The town is not to be confused with the most famous Königsberg, the former East Prussian city of Königsberg in Preußen (since 1945 Kaliningrad, Russia), nor with Königsberg in der Neumark (since 1945 as Chojna in Poland). It was an exclave of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha until 1918, after having been a part of Saxe-Hildburghausen.
