Attila Csihar (Hungarian: [ˈɒtːilɒ ˈt͡ʃihɒr]; born 29 March 1971), also sometimes known as Void, is a Hungarian black metal vocalist, best known for his vocal work on Mayhem's De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas album. Author Ian Christe describes his vocals as "operatic."
His music career began in 1985 in the Hungarian metal band Tormentor, which reached cult status in black metal circles with their first album, Anno Domini. On the strength of his work in Tormentor, he was invited to perform vocals on the De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas album by Norwegian black metal band Mayhem after then-vocalist Dead committed suicide.
After Mayhem, Csihar continued to work in various bands, such as Plasma Pool, Aborym, and Korog; he also performed as Caiaphas in the rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar in Hungary. He briefly performed in Keep of Kalessin as well.
He is considered a shadow member of the American doom/drone metal band Sunn O))). He has recorded five full-length albums with the group, including the most successful Monoliths & Dimensions, and performed live with the band on their worldwide tours.
In 2004, Csihar rejoined Mayhem after the departure of Maniac, the band's previous vocalist. Their 2007 album, Ordo ad Chao, won the Spellemannprisen (also known as the Norwegian Grammy). Since then the band has embarked upon intense international touring.
He has also joined Greg Anderson of Sunn O))) and Oren Ambarchi in a project called Burial Chamber Trio, and in another project, Gravetemple with Stephen O'Malley of Sunn O))) and Oren Ambarchi.
Csihar started his solo act in November 2008, called Void ov Voices. The group's live performances have been in support of artists like Ulver, Bohren& der Club of Gore, Lustmord, Ruin and Diamanda Galas. He performed at "The Grand Reincarnation" Of Paul Booth’s Last Rites Gallery & Tattoo Theatre.
He has collaborated with such artists as Current 93, Jarboe, Dissection, Emperor, Taake, Ulver, Toby Knapp, Banks Violette, and Nader Sadek, the artist behind Csihar's masks with Sunn O))) and Mayhem.
He worked in film production, most notably on Tony Scott's Spy Game, where he was the first assistant of production designer Norris Spencer.
