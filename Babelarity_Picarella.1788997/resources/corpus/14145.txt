The 2010–11 2. Bundesliga was the 37th season of the 2. Bundesliga, Germany's second tier of its football league system. The season started on the weekend of 21 August 2010 and ended with the last games on 15 May 2011. The winter break was in effect between weekends around 18 December 2010 and 15 January 2011.
As in the previous year, the league comprise the teams placed fourth through fifteenth of the 2009–10 season, the worst two teams from the 2009–10 Bundesliga, the best two teams from the 2009–10 3rd Liga, the losers of the Bundesliga relegation play-off between the 16th-placed Bundesliga team and the third-placed 2nd Bundesliga team and the winners of the 2nd Bundesliga relegation play-off between the 16th-placed 2nd Bundesliga team and the third-placed 3rd Liga team.
2009–10 2. Bundesliga champions 1. FC Kaiserslautern, and runners-up FC St. Pauli were promoted to the Bundesliga. They were replaced by VfL Bochum and Hertha BSC who finished 17th and 18th respectively in the 2009–10 Bundesliga season.
TuS Koblenz and Rot-Weiß Ahlen were relegated after the 2009–10 season. They were replaced by 2009–10 3rd Liga champions VfL Osnabrück and runners-up FC Erzgebirge Aue.
Two further spots were available through relegation/promotion play-offs and taken by FC Augsburg and FC Ingolstadt 04. Augsburg lost in their promotion play-off against 16th placed Bundesliga team 1. FC Nuremberg and thus retained their 2. Bundesliga spot, while Ingolstadt earned promotion from the 3rd Liga by defeating FC Hansa Rostock.
FC Ingolstadt 04 moved into the newly built Audi Sportpark for this season after spending their previous seasons at Tuja-Stadion. Fortuna Düsseldorf increased the capacity of their Esprit Arena from 51,500 to 54,400 by converting some seating areas into standing terraces. Also, the stadia of SpVgg Greuther Fürth and MSV Duisburg were renamed due to new naming rights contracts.
Notes:
Erzgebirgsstadion is undergoing reconstruction. The capacity is thus estimated, with the exact number not to be known until work has been completed.
Fortuna Düsseldorf's home ground Esprit Arena was unavailable for the last three games of the season as it is set to stage the Eurovision Song Contest 2011. A temporary stadium, the airberlin world, was constructed adjacent to the Esprit Arena to host the final home games of the season.
