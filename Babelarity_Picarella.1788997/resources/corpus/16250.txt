Stanislaus "Stan" Henricus Christina Valckx (born 20 October 1963 in Arcen, Limburg) is a Dutch retired footballer who played as a central defender.
After starting professionally with VVV-Venlo (second division), Valckx moved in 1988 to Eredivisie club PSV Eindhoven, being instrumental in the conquest of three leagues and two Dutch Cups – in the 1991–92 season, he scored four goals in 28 matches as the team renewed their domestic supremacy.
In 1992, Valckx, aged 28, moved abroad, to Sporting Clube de Portugal, helping the Lisbon side to the Portuguese Cup three years later, although he did not play in the final against C.S. Marítimo as in October 1994 he had already returned to his country and PSV, where he won one more league and another domestic cup before retiring in June 2000 at nearly 37 years of age, with more than 500 official appearances to his credit.
Subsequently, Valckx began working as a technical director at PSV, a post he occupied for several years. In 2008 he got into a conflict with general manager Jan Reker about the influence and role of player agent Vlado Lemić at the club; the following year, in the same capacity, he joined China's Shanghai Shenhua FC.
In August 2010, Valckx was appointed director of football at Wisła Kraków from Poland. Four years later, he returned to VVV as a technical advisor.
Valckx earned 20 caps for the Netherlands, and was picked for the squad which appeared at the 1994 FIFA World Cup. He contributed with four games, in a quarter-final elimination at the hands of eventual champions Brazil.
Valckx made his debut for his country on 26 September 1990, in a friendly against Italy (0–0).
