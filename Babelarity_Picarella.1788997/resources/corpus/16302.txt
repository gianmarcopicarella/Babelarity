Omero Tognon (3 March 1924 â€“ 23 August 1990) is an Italian retired football player.
Born in Padua, Tognon was a solid center midfielder for Milan during the 1940s and 1950s. Tognon played eleven seasons with Milan making 335 appearances preceded only by Gianni Rivera, Paolo Maldini, Franco Baresi, Billy Costacurta, Mauro Tassotti, Nils Liedholm and Cesare Maldini. He formed a great tandem in midfield with Carlo Annovazzi. He was selected to the national team for the 1950 World Cup but, along with Emilio Caprile, Giuseppe Casari and Benito Lorenzi, he saw no action at the tournament. He would get another opportunity at the 1954 World Cup where he was immovable at central defense. The second game against Switzerland was his last cap for the 'Azzurri'. With Milan he won two championships, the first in 1951 having played 37 of 38 games, and the second in 1955 without playing any games.
