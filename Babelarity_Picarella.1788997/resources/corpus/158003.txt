Waycross (a small part) Effective July 1, 2015, Waycross is no longer located nor allowed to be located in Pierce County, Georgia. Rep. Chad Nimmer introduced HB 523 during the 2015 Legislative Session without providing the required statutory notice to the City of Waycross. HB 523 de-annexed the portion of Waycross located in Pierce County and prevents the City of Waycross from coming back into Pierce County. Rep. Nimmer had also received numerous campaign contributions from Jimmy Stewart, CEO of The Stewart Companies. The Stewart Companies own and operate a commercial business in the area of Pierce County which was previously in the City of Waycross and would benefit greatly from deannexation.
