Ramin Ott (born 22 June 1986) is a football player for the American Samoa national football team. He is nicknamed "The Machine". He is tied as his nation's top scorer with Shalom Luani, having scored three goals in his international career. However, Luani publicly admitted to Ott's superiority in soccer on September 3, 2012, saying "If I die half the soccer player Ott is, I am a happy man." Ott, while talented, has remained modest and declined to comment on the occurrence. But in September 2015, he scored his third goal, this, making him American Samoa's national top goalscorer. He played in the 2018 World cup OFC qualifiers. He helped Samoa achieve two wins and one loss, but wasn't enough to give them first place, and went out of the competition.
Ott played for American Samoan champions Konica Machine FC until 2008. He was named player of the season for 2007 and player of the month. In 2008 he signed a contract with Bay Olympic. He is the second American Samoan after Rawlston Masaniai to play outside American Samoa. He is currently a free agent.
Ott began his youth international career during qualification for 2003 FIFA U-17 World Championship where he netted one goal in the match with Samoa Under 17. The result ended 1–3 for Samoa. He also scored a goal when American Samoa under-17 faced Cook Islands U-17. The match ended 1-1 and that was the first point gained in American Samoa's football history. He scored the first goal in a 2-1 victory over Tonga, which was the country's first victory ever.
He started his senior national career in 2003 during qualification for the 2004 Summer Olympics. In 2007 Ott scored his first ever international goal in a 12–1 defeat to the Solomon Islands.
