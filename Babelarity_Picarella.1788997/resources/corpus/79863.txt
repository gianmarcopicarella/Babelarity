Kring's first job as a screenwriter was for the television show Knight Rider.

Kring and Loeb would collaborate again when producing Heroes. Kring also co-wrote the 2010 book Shift: A Novel (Gates of Orpheus Trilogy) with Dale Peck.
After the cancellation of Heroes in 2010 Kring created the TV series Touch, a drama focusing on a father (Kiefer Sutherland) who discovers that his mute son can predict future events. The series premiered on January 25, 2012 on Fox and was cancelled after two seasons on May 9, 2013.
On February 22, 2014, during its Olympics coverage, NBC announced Heroes is coming back as a 13-episode event miniseries titled Heroes Reborn. It will premiere in 2015 with creator Tim Kring as the executive producer.
Kring won an Emmy Award nomination in 2007 for Outstanding Drama Series as the producer for Heroes. He was also named one of the Masters of Sci Fi TV for his work on the series.
