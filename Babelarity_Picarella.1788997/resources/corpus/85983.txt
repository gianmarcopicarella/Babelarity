Märzen or Märzenbier (German: March or March beer) is a lager that originated in Bavaria. It has a medium to full body and may vary in color from pale through amber to dark brown.
Märzen (or alternatively Maerzen) has its origins in Bavaria, probably before the 16th century. A Bavarian brewing ordinance decreed in 1553 that beer may be brewed only between 29 September and 23 April. The Märzen was brewed in March (März in German is "March") according to a special recipe that would allow the beer to last while the brewing of new beer was forbidden between 24 April and 28 September. The original Märzen was described as "dark brown, full-bodied, and bitter". The beer was often kept in the cellar until late in the summer, and remaining bottles were served at the Oktoberfest.
The style is characterized by a medium to full body, a malty flavour, and a clean dry finish. In Germany, the term covers beers which vary in colour from pale (Helles Märzen), through amber to dark brown (Dunkles Märzen). Common names for Märzen include Märzenbier, Wiener Märzen, Festbier, and Oktoberfestbier.
The Austrian style is light in colour, body, and flavour balance, and is the most popular beer style among the beers in Austria. Austrian Märzenbiers often use caramel malts that impart a sweeter flavour than their German counterparts.
Brewers in the Czech Republic also produce pale, amber, and dark beers in the Märzen style, called respectively 14° Světlé Speciální Pivo, Polotmavé Speciální Pivo, and Tmavé Speciální Pivo.
