Lake Velence is the third largest lake in Hungary. It is a popular holiday destination among Hungarians.
The lake has an area of 26 km2, one third of which is covered by the common reed. Because of the sunny climate of the area and the shallowness of the lake, it is one of the warmest lakes in Europe: its temperature in the summer may reach 26 to 28 °C.
Lake Velence is located in Fejér county, close to the M7motorway between Budapest and Székesfehérvár, at the feet of Velence Mountains.
The lake is a bird reserve.
