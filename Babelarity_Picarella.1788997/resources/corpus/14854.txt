During this season, under the guidance of Fabio Capello, A.C. Milan completed a remarkable unbeaten season, a run that eventually totalled 58 games. They finished eight points ahead of Serie A runners-up Juventus. However, it was a disappointing season for Inter Milan, who could only manage an eighth place finish, meaning that 1992-93 would bring no European action for them - something which had been a rare occurrence over the last three decades. Defending champions Sampdoria finished sixth and their last chance of European action for the following season was lost when they were beaten by the Spanish champions Barcelona in the final of the European Cup. Bari, Verona (the 1985 champions), Cremonese and Ascoli were all relegated.
