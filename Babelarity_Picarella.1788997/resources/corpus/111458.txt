Norodom Suramarit (Khmer: នរោត្តម សុរាម្រិត) (6 March 1896 – 3 April 1960) was King of Cambodia from 1955 until his death in 1960. He was the father of King Norodom Sihanouk and the grandfather of Cambodia's current king, Norodom Sihamoni. Suramarit was born in Phnom Penh. He was the son of Prince Norodom Sutharot and grandson of King Norodom.
Norodom Sihanouk was both Suramarit's predecessor and successor as the head of the state. Suramarit was a nephew of King Sisowath Monivong. Surmarit became Monivong's son-in-law when he married Monivong's daughter. Upon the Monivong's death in 1941, Sihanouk, Suramarit's son and Monivong's grandson, was selected as the new king. In 1955, Sihanouk abdicated in favor of his father. Following Suramarit's death in 1960, Norodom Sihanouk again became head of state (although he did not formally regain the title of king until after other periods in 1993). He was given the posthumous title of Preah Karuna Preah Norodom Suramarit Preah Moha Kachanakkot.
King Norodom Suramarit was married to Queen Sisowath Kosamak, daughter of King Sisowath Monivong who remained Queen Mother after her husband's death.
