In Hinduism, the Daityas (Sanskrit: दैत्य) are a clan or race of Asura as are the Danavas. Daityas were the children of Diti and the sage Kashyapa. They were a race of giants who fought against the Devas because they were jealous of their Deva half-brothers. The female Daityas are described as wearing jewelry the size of boulders. Manu Smriti (XII - 48) classifies Daityas as ones possessing the quality of goodness but places them at a level lower than Gods: "Hermits, ascetics, Brahmanas, the crowds of the Vaimanika deities, the lunar mansions, and the Daityas (form) the first (and lowest rank of the) existences caused by Goodness."
Some of the notable daityas mentioned in the Indian mythology include:
Hiranyaksha - eldest son of Kashyapa and Diti
Hiranyakashipu - second son of Kashyapa and Diti
Holika or Sinhika - daughter of Kashyapa and Diti
Prahlada - son of Hiranyakashipu
Virochana - son of Prahlada, father of Bali
