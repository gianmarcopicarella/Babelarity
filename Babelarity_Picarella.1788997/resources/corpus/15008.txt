The 2011 Critérium du Dauphiné, was the 63rd running of the Critérium du Dauphiné (formerly Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré) cycling stage race. It started on 5 June in Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne and ended on 12 June in La Toussuire and consisted of eight stages, including a race-commencing prologue stage and an individual time trial, held as the third stage. It was the 15th race of the 2011 UCI World Tour season.
The race was won by Team Sky rider Bradley Wiggins, who claimed the leader's yellow and blue jersey after a strong finish on the individual time trial stage, and maintained his advantage to the end of the race. Wiggins' winning margin over runner-up Cadel Evans of BMC Racing Team was 1 minute and 26 seconds, and Astana's Alexander Vinokourov completed the podium, 23 seconds down on Evans.
In the race's other classifications, Team Katusha rider Joaquim Rodríguez won both the King of the Mountains classification, and the green jersey for the points classification, Saur–Sojasun's Jérôme Coppel won the young rider classification, with Team Europcar finishing at the head of the teams classification.
