Theresa Kunegunda (Polish: Teresa Kunegunda Sobieska, German: Kurfürstin Therese Kunigunde) (4 March 1676 – 10 March 1730) was a Polish princess, an Electress of Bavaria and of the Electorate of the Palatinate. She also served as Regent of the Palatinate in 1704–05.
She was a daughter of the Polish King John III Sobieski and Marie Casimire Louise de la Grange d'Arquien. Theresa Kunegunda Sobieska married Maximilian II Emanuel, elector of Bavaria, on 2 January 1695. She was mother of ten children by her husband, including Holy Roman Emperor Charles VII and Clemens August of Bavaria, Archbishop-Elector of Cologne, though only half of them survived till adulthood.
In 1704–05, following the evacuation of the Bavarian court to the Spanish Netherlands after the defeat at the Battle of Blenheim, she apparently was in charge of the government in the Electorate of the Palatinate as Regent Princess Palatine. However, when she left to see her mother, the army would not allow her to return. Therefore, Theresa spent ten years in exile, only returning in 1715.
She rests in the Theatine Church in Munich.
