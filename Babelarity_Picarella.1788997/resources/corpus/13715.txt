César Arzo Amposta (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈθesaɾ ˈarθo]; born 21 January 1986) is a Spanish footballer who plays for Kazakh club FC Kairat as a central defender.
Arzo was born in Villarreal, Valencian Community. He came through the ranks of hometown club Villarreal CF, making his debut for the first team on 23 March 2003 against Real Sociedad but never being able to consolidate himself in the starting XI, however.
In the 2006–07 season, Arzo was loaned to La Liga newcomers Recreativo de Huelva alongside teammates Javier López Vallejo and Santi Cazorla, moving in the same predicament for the following campaign, this time to another promotee, Real Murcia. Immediately after returning from his latter loan he was deemed surplus to requirements by Villarreal boss Manuel Pellegrini, rejoining, now definitely, Recreativo on a free transfer.
Arzo returned to Villarreal in July 2009, as the club retained an option to buy back from Huelva. However, he was immediately sold, signing a four-year contract with Real Valladolid as well as former Villarreal teammate Marcos.
In the 2011 summer, aged 25, Arzo moved abroad, going on to represent in the following years K.A.A. Gent (Belgium), Beitar Jerusalem FC (Israel) and AEK Athens FC (Greece). This was interspersed with a five-month spell back in his country, with Real Zaragoza.
On 5 July 2016, Arzo signed a two-year contract with Kazakhstan Premier League side FC Kairat.
