Mashed potato is a dish prepared by mashing boiled potatoes. Recipes started appearing no later than 1747 with an entry in The Art of Cookery by Hannah Glasse. Dehydrated and frozen mashed potatoes are available in many supermarkets.
The use of "floury" types of potato is recommended, although "waxy" potatoes are sometimes used for a different texture. Butter, vegetable oil, milk and/or cream are usually added to improve flavor and texture, and the potatoes are seasoned with salt, pepper, and any other desired herbs and spices. Popular ingredients and seasonings include: garlic, cheese, bacon bits, sour cream, crisp onion or spring onion, caramelised onion, mustard, spices such as nutmeg, and chopped herbs such as parsley.
One French variation adds egg yolk for pommes duchesse or Duchess potatoes; piped through a pastry tube into wavy ribbons and rosettes, brushed with butter and lightly browned. Pomme pur√©e (potato puree) uses considerably more butter than normal mashed potato - up to two parts potato for one part butter. In low-calorie or non-dairy variations, milk, cream and butter may be replaced by soup stock or broth. Aloo Bharta, an Indian sub-continent variation, uses chopped onions, mustard (oil, paste or seeds), chili pepper, coriander leaves and other spices.
Mashed potatoes can be served together with other dishes, or can be an ingredient of various other dishes, including shepherd's and cottage pie, pierogi, colcannon, dumplings, potato croquettes, gnocchi, etc.. It is often served with sausages in the British Isles, often known as bangers and mash .
A potato masher is a utensil which can be used to prepare the potatoes, as is a potato ricer.
The dish was popularised and featured extensively as a running theme in the BBC children's comedy Bodger and Badger which starred Andy Cunningham and had a broadcast run of a decade from 1989 to 1999.
