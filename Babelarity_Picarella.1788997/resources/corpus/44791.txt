The Shadowthrone is the second studio album by Norwegian black metal band Satyricon. It was released on 12 September 1994, through Moonfog Productions.
The band have described The Shadowthrone as "an atmospheric and symphonic album with a strong Nordic touch. There are less acoustic guitars and medieval influences, and it is harsher and grimmer than the debut Dark Medieval Times, although it maintains the atmosphere."
All songs written and composed by Satyr.
