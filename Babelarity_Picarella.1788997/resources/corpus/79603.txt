Ruggero Pasquarelli (born 10 September 1993) is an Italian singer and actor. In 2010, he took part in the fourth series of the Italian talent show X Factor. He is also known for his performance as Federico in the Argentine telenovela Violetta  and as Matteo Balsano in Soy Luna.
Ruggero Pasquarelli was born in Pescara, Abruzzo, on 10 September 1993, to Bruno and Antonella Pasquarelli, and he grew up in Citt√† Sant'Angelo, a town in the province of Pescara. As a child, he took guitar and acting lessons. In 2008, Pasquarelli started taking singing lessons, and since 2009 he also studied piano. In high school, Pasquarelli studied at the pedagogical liceo, and specialized in Arts and Entertainment. While he was a high school student, he also became a singer of the local rock band 65013.
In 2010, during his last year at high school, Pasquarelli auditioned for the fourth series of the Italian talent show X Factor. As a result, he was chosen by Mara Maionchi as a member of the "Boys" category. During the seventh live show, Pasquarelli finished in the bottom two for the first time, together with Cassandra Raffaele, but only Raffaele's judge, Elio, voted to eliminate Pasquarelli, and he was therefore saved. He finished once again in the bottom two during the tenth live show. Pasquarelli was not allowed to perform during the final showdown, since he was 17 years old, and Italian laws don't allow performances of people under the age of majority after midnight. A pre-recorded performance was broadcast instead. The judges vote resulted in a deadlock, and the public vote saved Nevruz, and Pasquarelli finished the competition in sixth place.
