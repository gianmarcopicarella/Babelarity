Roy Lassiter (born March 9, 1969 in Washington, D.C.) is a retired American soccer striker. He is the father of LA Galaxy player Ariel Lassiter.
Lassiter was born in Washington, D.C., but grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina where he attended Athens Drive High School. He was the North Carolina State 4-A Player of the Year as a senior and a high school All-American. That year, he led his high school soccer team to the state championship while scoring a state record 47 goals. He also played for a local youth club, Raleigh United, which lost to the LaJolla Nomads in the 1989 McGuire National Club Championship Cup. Lassiter attended Lees-McRae College in 1989. He then transferred to North Carolina State University where he was a 1991 First Team All-ACC and All South.
While convalesing, Lassiter was contacted by Turrialba from Costa Rica in 1992. As Lassiter recalls it, "I have no idea how they got my name. They paid for my trip down there while still recovering from my leg injury, and I signed a contract." He also played for Carmelita and in summer 1995, Alajuelense sold him to Major League Soccer.
In 1996, Lassiter won the top goalscorer award in Major League Soccer, scoring 27 goals for Tampa Bay Mutiny, after when he was loaned for 6 months to Italian Serie B side Genoa. Lassiter was traded to DC United in 1998 for Roy Wegerle. He played two seasons in DC, winning the MLS Cup in 1999. Lassiter was traded to the Miami Fusion in 2000 due to salary cap, to the Kansas City Wizards in 2001, and back to DC in the middle of the 2002 season. He ended his MLS career with 88 regular season goals, a record surpassed in 2004 by Jason Kreis. Lassiter added 13 goals in MLS playoffs and is 3rd in that category behind Carlos Ruiz and Landon Donovan. He ended his professional career with A-League's Virginia Beach Mariners in 2003 as player/assistant coach, but played a few games with Laredo Heat of the USL Premier Development League and the exhibition Austin Posse in 2004 to help promote their clubs.262
Lassiter was called up to the U.S. national team in January 1992. He earned his first cap as a substitute for Eric Wynalda in a 1-0 loss to the Commonwealth of Independent States which briefly succeeded the Soviet Union. However, he broke his leg in a practice collision with Bruce Murray a few days later. That year he also earned his second cap with the national team when he came in as a sub for Frank Klopas in an August 16 loss to Sweden. Two months later, he played a third time for the national team, again as a substitute, this time for Roy Wegerle. Lassiter scored the game-winning goal in a 4-3 victory over Saudi Arabia. Lassiter's career continued to rise, he earned his first start for the national team in December 1996 and became a regular for much of 1997. While Lassiter had played consistently for the U.S. in 1997 his appearances tapered off in 1998 and he was selected as an alternate for the 1998 FIFA World Cup roster. He played only one game in 2000, his last with the national team. He represented his country in 4 FIFA World Cup qualification matches and finished his international career with 34 caps and 4 goals.
