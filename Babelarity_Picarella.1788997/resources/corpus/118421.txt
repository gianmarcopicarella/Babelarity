1226 Golia, provisional designation 1930 HL, is a stony asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, about 16 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 22 April 1930 by Dutch astronomer Hendrik van Gent at the Leiden Southern Station, annex to the Johannesburg Observatory in South Africa.
The S-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.3–2.9 AU once every 4 years and 2 months (1,516 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.11 and is tilted by 10 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. It has a rotation period of 4.1 hours although its rotational direction remains unknown. It has a geometric albedo of 0.24 and 0.17, according to the surveys carried out by Infrared Astronomical Satellite, IRAS, and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, respectively.
The asteroid is named after Dutch orientalist and mathematician, Jakob Gool (1596–1667), also known as Jacobus Golius. He was the founder of the Leiden Observatory in 1633, first professor of astronomy, and a teacher of French philosopher René Descartes, after whom the minor planet 3587 Descartes is named.
