The Arab Cup Winners' Cup (Arabic: الكأس العربية للأندية الفائزة بالكؤوس‎‎) was a football competition between the winning clubs of national cup competitions in Arab nations. It started in 1989 and merged with the Arab Club Champions Cup in 2002 to form the Prince Faysal bin Fahad Tournament for Arab Clubs.
