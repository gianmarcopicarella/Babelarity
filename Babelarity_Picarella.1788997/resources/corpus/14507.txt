Uwe Bein (born 26 September 1960 in Heringen) is a former German footballer.
Although, due to his reserved nature, he was never able to gain large public fame, his fans and experts call him one of the most technically gifted German midfielders of his time. In his heyday Bein was regarded as the best German player to play the deadly pass.
Bein's professional career began in 1978 with Kickers Offenbach, before he moved to 1. FC Köln, Hamburger SV and Eintracht Frankfurt. He played 300 Bundesliga games and scored 91 goals in total. He also helped Köln to the 1986 UEFA Cup Final where his goal could not prevent them losing to Real Madrid. In 1994 he moved to Japan and started playing for Urawa Red Diamonds in 1996. In 1997 he made appearances for VfB Gießen.
The biggest success in Bein's career occurred during the 1990 FIFA World Cup, where he played four of seven games before suffering from an injury. He scored one goal in the 5–1 win over the United Arab Emirates. He started all three group matches plus the quarter final against Czechoslovakia but didn't play in the final.
He didn't take part in the Euro 92. Lacking support from the German head coach Berti Vogts, Bein finally retired from the national team in 1993, and thus didn't take part in the World Cup 1994.
In total, he played 17 international matches, with three goals to his credit.
After his playing career ended he managed for half a year Kickers Offenbach in 2005.
