Gabú is the largest town in eastern Guinea-Bissau and capital of the Gabú Region. Population 14,336 (2008 est).
The town is known for its Fula population and dominant Muslim religion. It was originally the centre of the Kaabu empire until the Fouta Djallon came to dominate it in the nineteenth century. Gabú is also known as a market town and a centre for trade with Guinea and Senegal. After the independence of Guiné-Bissau, the city acquired its actual name, replacing the old one, "Nova Lamego".
