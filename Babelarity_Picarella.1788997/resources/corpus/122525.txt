A simile (/ˈsɪməli/) is a figure of speech that directly compares two things. Although similes and metaphors are similar, similes explicitly use connecting words (such as like, as, so, than, or various verbs such as resemble), though these specific words are not always necessary. While similes are mainly used in forms of poetry that compare the inanimate and the living, there are also terms in which similes and personifications are used for humorous purposes and comparison.
"O My Luve's like a red, red rose." "A Red, Red Rose," by Robert Burns.
John Milton, Paradise Lost, a Homeric simile:
As when a prowling Wolf,Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey,Watching where Shepherds pen thir Flocks at eveIn hurdl'd Cotes amid the field secure,Leaps o'er the fence with ease into the Fold:. . . . . . .So clomb this first grand Thief into God's Fold

Similes are used extensively in British comedy, notably in the slapstick era of the 1960s and 1970s. In comedy, the simile is often used in negative style: "he was as daft as a brush." They are also used in comedic context where a sensitive subject is broached, and the comedian will test the audience with response to a subtle implicit simile before going deeper. The sitcom Blackadder featured the use of extended similes, normally said by the title character. Examples include from the episode "Ink and Incapability" from Blackadder the Third, where Edmund Blackadder says to Prince George: "I have a horrid suspicion that Baldrick's plan will be the stupidest thing we've heard since Lord Nelson's famous signal at the Battle of the Nile: 'England knows Lady Hamilton is a virgin, poke my eye out and cut off my arm if I'm wrong.'"
