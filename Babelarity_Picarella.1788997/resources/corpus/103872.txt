Rogers County is a county located in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Oklahoma. As of the 2010 census, the population was 86,905. Its county seat is Claremore, making it the sixth largest county in Oklahoma based on population. The county was originally created in 1907 from the western Saline District of the Cherokee Nation and named the Cooweescoowee District. However, the residents protested and the name was changed to Rogers County, after Clem Vann Rogers, a mixed-blood Cherokee rancher and father of Will Rogers.
Rogers County is included in the Tulsa, OK Metropolitan Statistical Area.
According to the Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture, the Arkansas Band of the Osage Nation settled in the Three Forks area (the junction of the Arkansas River, Grand River and Verdigris River during the 1760s and established two villages called Pasuga and Pasona in what is now Rogers County. Pasona was near a mound on the Verdigris River called Claremore Mound. The name honored Chief Claremore (Gra-mon or Arrow Going Home).
In 1828, Cherokee tribes exchanged their Arkansas land for an area that included present-day Rogers County that had been ceded by the Osage in 1825. The area became the Saline District of the Cherokee Nation in Indian Territory and later the Cooweescoowee District.
Upon statehood, the county was created and designated Cooweescoowee County before being renamed Rogers County in honor of Clement Rogers.
Shortly after statehood, Eastern University Preparatory School was established on College Hill, just west of Claremore, Oklahoma. The Oklahoma Military Academy was established in 1919. The academy was closed and Claremore Junior College was opened in 1971. The state legislature renamed the institution Rogers State College and Rogers University before settling on Rogers State University in 1998.
