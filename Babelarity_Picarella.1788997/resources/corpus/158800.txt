Alburquerque Spanish pronunciation: [alβurˈkerke] is a town in the province of Badajoz in Spain. It has 5,600 inhabitants. It is very close to the border with Portugal and was an ancient dominion of the kings of this country. The origin of the name of the town is uncertain. It is believed to stem from Latin, alba quercus, or "the white oak". Another theory suggests that it may come from the Arabic Abu al-Qurq, which means "father of the cork [oak]".
The titles of Lord of Alburquerque (de Meneses) and later Count of Alburquerque (de Castilla) and Duke of Alburquerque (de La Cueva) were important in Castile in the Middle Ages, see e.g. Sancho Alfonso, 1st Count of Alburquerque.
Its sister city of Albuquerque in the United States takes its name from this town (but note the spelling difference: the lack of the 'r' after the first 'u').
