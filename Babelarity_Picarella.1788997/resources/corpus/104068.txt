Lausanne railway station (French: Gare de Lausanne) is the main intercity and regional railway station for the city of Lausanne, Vaud, Switzerland. It is often known as Lausanne CFF to distinguish it from others in the town.
Lausanne is a through station, which sits at the junction of the Simplon, Olten–Lausanne and Lausanne–Geneva railway lines. Due to this, express passenger trains are available to a wide variety of destinations across the country.
Passenger trains are primarily run by SBB CFF FFS, the Swiss national rail company, with additional international trains run by companies from neighbouring France (TGV), Germany (ICE) and Italy (Cisalpino), with services to Barcelona provided by Elipsos (a joint venture by Spanish RENFE and French SNCF).
There is also a network of local services from Lausanne, primarily as part of the Léman RER, and platforms for line 2 of the Lausanne Métro.
Passenger facilities include Bureau de change, left luggage and lost property offices.
Significant improvements are planned for the station by 2020. A third subway is to be constructed for platform access, along with longer platforms to allow larger trains. A new tunnel is also to be built for the Lausanne Métro directly underneath the Renens (West) end of the main line station, with new métro platforms directly connected to the subway, removing the need for some métro passengers to cross the square in front of the station.
