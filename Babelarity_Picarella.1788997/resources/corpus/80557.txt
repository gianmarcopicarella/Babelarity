Emmanuel Carrère (born 9 December 1957) is a French author, screenwriter and film director.
He is the son of Louis Édouard Carrère, often known as Louis Carrère d'Encausse, after his mother, the historian and Académie française member, Hélène Carrère d'Encausse.
Carrère studied at the Institut d'études politiques de Paris (better known as Sciences Po). Much of his writing, both fiction and nonfiction, centers around the primary themes of the interrogation of identity, the development of illusion and the direction of reality. Several of his books have been made into films; in 2005, he personally directed the film adaptation of his novel La Moustache. He was the president of the jury of the book Inter 2003.
He was a member of the International jury at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival in May. He was a member of the jury for the Cinéfoundation and Short Films sections of the 2012 Cannes Film Festival.
In 2015, he was named as a member of the Jury for the Main Competition at the 2015 Venice Film Festival. The festival is chaired by Alfonso Cuarón.
