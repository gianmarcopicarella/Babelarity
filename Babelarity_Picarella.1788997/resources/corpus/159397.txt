Cosquín is the oldest town in the scenic Punilla Valley; the region was already populated by the 16th century. Cosquín was officially founded with the title of villa (town) on 4 August 1876, and declared a city on 26 August 1939.
In the past, the region of Cosquín was appreciated for its benign climate, recommended by physicians for pulmonary ailments, and a whole industry of hospitals and therapeutic establishments appeared in order to provide services to patients from Argentina and even other countries. As the popularity of this kind of treatment decreased, the economy of Cosquín became more focused on tourism.
