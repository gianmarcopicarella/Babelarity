The 2009 Wimbledon Championships took place on the outdoor grass courts at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in Wimbledon, London, from Monday 22 June through to Sunday 5 July 2009. It was the 123rd staging of the Wimbledon Championships, and the third Grand Slam tennis event of the year.
Rafael Nadal did not defend his title after withdrawing from the tournament due to knee tendinitis. Roger Federer won his 6th Wimbledon title defeating rival Andy Roddick in the final in five sets. Federer's victory marked his fifteenth Grand Slam title which broke the men's all-time record. Venus Williams was unsuccessful in her title defence, being defeated in the final by her sister Serena, who won her first Wimbledon in 2003.
 Roger Federer def.  Andy Roddick, 5–7, 7–6(8-6), 7–6(7-5), 3–6, 16–14
It was Federer's 3rd title of the year, and his 60th overall. Federer's victory gave him his 15th career Grand Slam title, to make him the most successful male player in Grand Slam history. Watching the Swiss break the record was Pete Sampras, who won 14 Grand Slam titles and was making his first return to Wimbledon since 2002, Björn Borg, who won five consecutive Wimbledon titles (the only other man doing this being Roger Federer himself), and Rod Laver, who won Wimbledon four times.
The match set a record for most games in a men's final (77); the most games won by the losing player (39); and, most games won by the winning player (38).
 Serena Williams def.  Venus Williams, 7–6(7-3), 6–2
It was Serena's 2nd title of the year, and her 34th overall. It was her 11th career Grand Slam title, and her 3rd Wimbledon title.

Swiss Roger Federer established a number of records at the 2009 Wimbledon Championships. By defeating Ivo Karlović in the quarterfinals, Federer reached his 21st consecutive Grand Slam semi-final, having started the streak at Wimbledon in 2004. He then defeated Tommy Haas in the semi-final to reach his 7th consecutive Wimbledon final and his 20th Grand Slam final, both all-time records. Finally, by defeating Andy Roddick in the final, Federer won his 15th Grand Slam title, breaking Pete Sampras's previous record of 14. Federer also became the fourth man to complete the rare French Open-Wimbledon double in the Open Era, joining Rod Laver, Björn Borg and Rafael Nadal, who completed the feat the previous year and would do so again the following year.
Among other records set, the men's final had the highest number of viewers in the UK of any Wimbledon final since 2001, peaking at 11.1 million viewers during the last stretch of the match, and the 30-game fifth set in the men's final between Federer and Roddick was the longest in Wimbledon finals history.
The 2009 Championships coincided with an extended period of hot, dry weather in south-east England. This meant that it was only on day seven of the tournament (29 June) that the newly constructed Centre Court roof was closed for the first time due to rain, delaying a match between Amélie Mauresmo and Dinara Safina. The following match between Andy Murray and Stanislas Wawrinka was the first full-length match played under the new roof; thanks to the new floodlights, it was also the latest finish ever at Wimbledon, ending at 22:38. Murray won the match 6–3 in the fifth set. These were the only two matches in which the roof was used. The record for latest finish has since been surpassed by Andy Murray in his 4 set match against Baghdatis in 2012 which ended at 23:02.
The Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU) planned to observe matches played by up to 12 players (some of whom were inside the ATP top 50) throughout the tournament. The TIU has existed since January 2008.
The ATP claimed to have identified Russian and Italian Mafia-related groups behind suspicious betting at other tournaments, although the organizers of the Wimbledon Championships declared that there are no current proceedings against any players.
Men's Singles
Women's Singles
The first day of Wimbledon 2009 saw 2008 Men's Singles runner-up and five-time Wimbledon Champion Roger Federer open on Centre Court due to defending champion and number 1 seed Rafael Nadal withdrawing due to injury.

Some of the day's winners were 2008 Australian Open Champion Novak Djoković, 2009 French Open finalist Robin Söderling, Fernando Verdasco, Marin Čilić, Ivo Karlović, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Mardy Fish and former French Open champion Guillermo Cañas.

Two matches were suspended in the first day: the matches between Michaël Llodra and Joshua Goodall, and Tommy Haas and Alexander Peya. However the first major upset of the tournament came when Italy's Andreas Seppi defeated Queen's Club finalist James Blake in straight sets 7–5 6–4 7–6(5).
