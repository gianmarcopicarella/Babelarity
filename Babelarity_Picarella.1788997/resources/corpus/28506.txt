The San Giorgio-class amphibious transport dock (LPD) were built by Fincantieri for the Italian Navy. These ships can carry a battalion of troops, and up to 36 armored vehicles. The stern floodable dock can accommodate three landing craft and the flight deck has three landing spots. San Giusto is normally employed as a training ship. The ships are based at the Brindisi naval base on the Adriatic coast.
The two oldest vessels of this class are scheduled for replacement. The Italian Navy has received the go-ahead to procure two 21,000/24,000-ton 190-metre (620 ft) long amphibious assault ships (Landing Helicopter Dock), with the possibility of a third ship, configured with extensive aviation facilities (Landing Helicopter Assault).
On July 2011 the Algerian Navy placed an order with Fincantieri for an improved version of the San Giorgio class amphibious transport ships classified as Bâtiment de Débarquement et de Soutien Logistique (BDSL). On 8 January 2014 the BDSL was launched on a barge at the Fincantieri shipyard in Sestri Levante. Kalaat Béni-Abbès is set to be fitted with Aster 15 and Aster 30 behind the island superstructure, with one OTO Melara 76 mm Super Rapid at the bow and with two 25mm remote weapon stations. The BDSL can accommodate three Landing Craft Mechanized, three small Landing Craft Vehicle Personnel, one large Landing Craft Personnel and two semi-rigid boats. The hangar can accommodate up to 15 armoured vehicles. The crew will consist of 150 sailors while the ship may accommodate a landing force of 440 soldiers.
