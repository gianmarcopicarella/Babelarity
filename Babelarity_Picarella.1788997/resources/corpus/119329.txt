1209 Pumma, provisional designation 1927 HA, is a carbonaceous asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt, about 25 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at Heidelberg Observatory on 22 April 1927.
The C-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.8–3.6 AU once every 5 years and 8 months (2,058 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.13 and is tilted by 7 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. It has a rotation period of 8.5 hours and an albedo of 0.02 and 0.14, respectively, depending on two different data-sets from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and NEOWISE mission. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL) assumes a low albedo of 0.06 and calculated the body's diameter to be much larger, about 42 kilometers.
The minor planet was named after the nickname of the niece of Albrecht Kahrstedt (1897–1971), after whom the asteroid 1587 Kahrstedt is named. The name "Pumma" was proposed by Albrecht Kahrstedt himself.
