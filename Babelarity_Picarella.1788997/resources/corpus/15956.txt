Justin Ray "J. R." Giddens (born February 13, 1985) is an American professional basketball player for the Instituto de Córdoba of the Liga Nacional de Básquet (LNB). He was selected with the 30th overall pick in the 2008 NBA Draft by the Boston Celtics out of the University of New Mexico. He initially played for the University of Kansas but transferred following his sophomore season.
Giddens accepted a scholarship offer from University of Kansas from then-head coach Roy Williams. After Williams left, Giddens was persuaded to stay by Williams' replacement Bill Self. In his first year at Kansas, Giddens earned All-Big 12 Conference Freshman honors while averaging 11 points per game. In May 2005 he was involved in a fight outside a bar in Lawrence and received a stab wound. He was later charged with battery for his role in the incident and left Kansas in a mutual agreement with Self. Giddens transferred to New Mexico and sat out the next season due to NCAA regulations. As a junior, he was suspended from the team in late February for disciplinary reasons and missed the team's summer trip to work on his academics. New Mexico hired head coach Steve Alford, who took a no-nonsense approach to discipline, and Giddens made a dramatic transformation. As a senior he was named Mountain West Conference Co-Player of the Year and Honorable Mention All-American following career highs in points (16.3 per game) and rebounds (8.8 per game).
On June 26, 2008, Giddens was selected by the Boston Celtics with the 30th overall pick in the 2008 NBA Draft. He had worked out with the Celtics for three days, and received praises from head coach Doc Rivers, who thought he could fight for minutes on the team right away. He was even mentioned as a possible replacement for restricted free agent Tony Allen. Giddens was already familiar with Leon Powe and Kendrick Perkins, who were his teammates at the 2003 McDonald's All-American Game. But on behalf of his agent Aaron Mintz, Giddens declined to work out at the Celtics' minicamp in early July, because he had not signed a contract yet.
On November 15, 2008, Giddens was assigned to the Boston Celtics' NBA Development League affiliate team, the Utah Flash. He had played with the Celtics in the 2008–09 pre-season but had been on the inactive list for the first 10 games of the regular season. He was recalled by the Celtics from Utah Flash development team on February 8, 2009.
Giddens started his first game for the Boston Celtics on January 2, 2010.
On February 18, 2010, Giddens, Bill Walker and Eddie House were traded to the New York Knicks for Nate Robinson and Marcus Landry.
On October 13, 2010, Giddens's agent said that Giddens would spend the 2010-11 season with Asseco Prokom Gdynia in Poland, but Giddens left the team in December 2010 by mutual consent.
In September 2011, Giddens signed with PAOK Thessaloniki of Greece.
In September 2012, Giddens signed with Basket Brescia Leonessa, an Italian Legadue team.
On June 30, 2014, he signed with Vaqueros de Bayamón of Puerto Rico.
On November 22, 2014, Giddens signed with Peñarol de Mar del Plata of Argentina. On March 10, 2015, he was waived by the Peñarol after appearing in seventeen LNB games.
