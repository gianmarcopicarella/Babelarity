Ĵ or ĵ (J circumflex) is a letter in Esperanto orthography representing the sound [ʒ].
While Esperanto orthography uses a diacritic for its four postalveolar consonants, as do the Latin-based Slavic alphabets, the base letters are Romano-Germanic. Ĵ is based on the French pronunciation of the letter j to better preserve the shape of borrowings from that language (such as ĵurnalo from journal) than Slavic ž would.
Ĵ is the fourteenth letter of the Esperanto alphabet. Although it is written as jx and jh respectively in the x-system and h-system workarounds, it is normally written as J with a circumflex: ĵ.
