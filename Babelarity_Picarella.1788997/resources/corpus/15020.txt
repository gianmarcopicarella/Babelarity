Jovan Kirovski (Macedonian: Јован Кировски) (born March 18, 1976 in Escondido, California) is a former American soccer player who is currently an assistant coach for Los Angeles Galaxy in Major League Soccer.
Kirovski, the son of Macedonian immigrants, joined Manchester United's youth team in 1992, becoming the first American to sign with the club. He led the reserve team in scoring in 1996, but was not able to break into the first team because of work permit regulations. After that season, he signed with Borussia Dortmund in the German Bundesliga. Kirovski spent the next four seasons in Germany, playing sparingly for Dortmund; he did however play in Dortmund's 1996–97 UEFA Champions League campaign, becoming the first American to win the competition. This was despite being left out of the squad for the final altogether. His only significant playing time in Germany was in the 1998–99 season, when Borussia loaned him out to second division club Fortuna Köln.
In 2000, Kirovski signed with Portuguese club Sporting CP, but once again could not get much playing time. After a season there, he went back to England, signing with Football League First Division club Crystal Palace. In 2002, Kirovski signed with Birmingham City, but after one and a half seasons and not much first-team action there, he signed with the Los Angeles Galaxy.
In his first season in MLS, Kirovski scored eight goals. In 2005, the Galaxy traded him to the Colorado Rapids for a first round pick in the 2007 MLS SuperDraft. After spending the 2008 season with the San Jose Earthquakes, he rejoined the Galaxy in a November 2008 trade. On January 23, 2012, Kirovski retired from soccer but remained on the coaching staff for the LA Galaxy as an assistant coach.
Kirovski made his debut for the United States national team at the age of 18 on October 19, 1994, against Saudi Arabia, and played at the 1996 Olympics and the 1999 and 2003 editions of the FIFA Confederations Cup. Kirovski earned 62 caps in total with the US, but was never selected for a World Cup squad.
Kirovski joined Los Angeles Galaxy as assistant coach immediately upon his retirement in January 2012. In January 2013, the Galaxy appointed him as the club's technical director.
