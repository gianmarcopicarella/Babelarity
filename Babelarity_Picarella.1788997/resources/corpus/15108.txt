Dr. Jozef Vengloš (born 18 February 1936) is a former Slovak football player and coach. He has a Doctorate in Physical Education, as well as specialising in Psychology. He has been selected by FIFA on various occasions to lecture at the FIFA academies throughout the world.
Born in Ružomberok, Czechoslovakia (present-day Slovakia), Vengloš played as a midfielder for Slovan Bratislava 1954–1966, and later captained the team, and also played for Czechoslovakia at the B level. After his playing career was prematurely ended by hepatitis, he began his managerial career in Australia, first in club football, before going on to manage the national team. He then returned to Czechoslovakia and coached at club and Under-23 national level.
In 1973, Vengloš was appointed as manager of Slovan Bratislava. During his three years in charge, he twice won the championship. He was also assistant manager of Czechoslovakia from 1973–1978. As assistant to Vaclav Jezek, he helped guide the team to victory in the Euro 1976, beating the Netherlands in the semi-finals and West Germany in the Final.
As manager of Czechoslovakia from 1978 to 1982, Vengloš led his side to 3rd place in the 1980 European Championship. He also led them to the 1982 World Cup Finals, where they went out in the first round. He then coached Sporting Lisbon from 1983 to 1984, before coaching in Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur FA & Malaysia). In 1988, he was re-appointed to manage Czechoslovakia and took them to the quarter-finals of the 1990 World Cup.
Following the World Cup, he took over at Aston Villa, becoming the first manager born outside Britain or Ireland to take charge of a top division club in England. He left after one season after they finished just two places above the First Division relegation zone. He then moved to the Turkish league, where he managed Fenerbahçe from 1991 to 1993. He was the first manager of the Slovakia national team from 1993 to 1995, before managing Oman 1996–1997.
Vengloš was appointed as Head Coach of Celtic on 17 July 1998. Season 1998–99 saw his Celtic team in some excellent form, but they failed to qualify for the Champions League and lost the League Championship and Scottish Cup to Rangers, who also won the Scottish League Cup, completing the treble. At the end of the season, Vengloš left to take up a new position as a European technical adviser and as a scout for Celtic. He is most credited for signing fans' idol Ľubomír Moravčík during his season as manager. Other successful signings include club legend Johan Mjallby and Australian striker Mark Viduka, and while a trophy evaded Vengloš, he is still looked upon fondly by fans for bringing such players to the club. The stand-out of his reign came as his Celtic side inflicted a punishing 5–1 defeat on arch-rivals Rangers in the first half of the season. In the new year of 1999, he also took Celtic to Ibrox where they held their Old Firm rivals to a 2–2 draw on their own soil.
He later managed Japanese team JEF United Ichihara for a season in 2002.
