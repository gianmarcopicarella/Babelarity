During the great depression of the 1930s Muhos was one of the municipalities where the deficiency movements (pulaliikkeet, signular pulaliike) started to organise as critique to the cabibet parties. After the municipal elections of the year 1933, the biggest political group in the municipal council of Muhos was Muhoksen pulatoimikunta which was an elemental part of the movement in the southern regions of Oulu. In 1933 they had seven members of the council. In the northern Finland as the deficit movement was based on the small peasants' and was a critique for the Agrarian League and Kyösti Kallio, but in some cases it was a critique to the Social Democratic Party of Finland as well. Some parts of the deficiency movement was financed moderately by the Communist Party of Finland as its activities were forbidden by law in (1930–1944) to the end of the continuation war. In the 1930s the Communistic movement of Finland tried to go on its work in the Social Democratic organisations, which were not banned in Finland and less also in the deficiency movement.
The deficiency movements demanded the state take more effective measures to help the small peasants to avoid the shameful compulsory auctions of the debt-driven small farms. Many of the farmsteads were bought in the auctions by the state and they were returned in later to their previous owners.
