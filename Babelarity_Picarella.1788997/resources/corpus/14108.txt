Davis attended high school at Chaminade College Preparatory School in Missouri. He joined Saint Louis University (SLU) in 2000, where he played for two seasons before leaving college soccer for the professional ranks. While at SLU, Davis was named the Conference USA Freshman of the Year his first year, and a second team NSCAA All-American as a sophomore.
Davis was selected third overall in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft by MetroStars. He scored four goals in 24 appearances in his debut season, and was a finalist for the MLS Rookie of the Year Award. He was then traded to Dallas Burn for the fourth overall pick in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft.
In his second year with the team, new coach Colin Clarke tried to move Davis to the center of the field to play attacking midfielder. After making little impact through several games, however, Davis returned to the left. There he had to compete with newcomer Eric Quill for playing time. Davis finished the season with only two goals and two assists despite playing more minutes than in 2003, as the Burn yet again missed the playoffs.
On MLS draft day 2005 Davis was traded to San Jose Earthquakes with cash and the #4 draft pick in exchange for Richard Mulrooney, Arturo Alvarez and the #6 draft pick. That season he made 18 MLS appearances for San Jose, scoring two goals. Davis did not appear for them in the MLS play-offs due to a groin strain. After the 2005 season, the club moved to Houston and was rechristened Houston Dynamo.
Following a 2011 season where he led MLS in assists, Davis was named a finalist for the league MVP Award. However, despite helping the Dynamo advance to their third-ever MLS Cup, Davis missed the final after suffering a torn quadriceps in an Eastern Conference Final win over Sporting Kansas City. During the 2012 season, he scored a personal best of 8 goals to lead the Houston Dynamo to the MLS Cup final. In 2013, he recorded 4 goals and 9 assists.
On January 7, 2016, Davis was traded to Sporting Kansas City for picks in the 2016 and 2017 MLS SuperDrafts as well as future considerations.
