Like all Brazilian football teams, Vila Nova has their own group of die-hard fans who call themselves 'TEV' – Torcida Esquadrão Vilanovense (usually referring to themselves as simply 'Esquadrão'). Many members of TEV come from an area of Goiánia called Zona Leste which is notorious for its crime rate. A popular song sung by TEV at Vila games is:
Vila, Vila, Vila minha vida,
Vila, Vila minha história,
Vila, Vila meu amor!
English translation
Vila, Vila, Vila my life,
Vila, Vila my history,
Vila, Vila my love!
Vila Nova's greatest rival is Goiás, with whom there is constant argument about which club has the largest fanbase. A common view is the claim that Vila Nova has the largest fanbase in Goiânia, and Goiás has the largest fanbase in Goiás state. Some Goiás supporters claim their club has also the biggest number of fans in Goiânia. Either way Vila Nova has an estimated fanbase of about 350,000, which is pretty big for a Brazilian second tier club. In the 2011 Série B season, Vila Nova will play Goiás (after Goias were relegated from Série A in 2010) for the first time in the Série B since 1998. They also encounter each other every year during the Campeonato Goiano (state championship). During a game on May 1, 2011 at the Serra Dourada, both teams were involved in a mass brawl on and off the pitch after the Campeonato Goiano semifinal.
