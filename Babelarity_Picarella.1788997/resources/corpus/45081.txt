Phillip John 'Phil' Mogg (born 15 April 1948, Wood Green, North London) is an English vocalist for the band UFO, which he formed with longtime friends Pete Way and Andy Parker. Mogg wrote the majority of the band's lyrics, with the music being written by Way, Michael Schenker, and later, Paul Raymond, but Schenker left to launch his solo career in 1979. Beginning in 1997, Mogg and Way, under the moniker Mogg/Way, released a couple of albums- Edge of the World and Chocolate Box. With UFO on hiatus, Phil formed another side project, $ign of 4. In late 2003, having regained the rights to the UFO name from Schenker, Mogg spoke with Pete Way and Paul Raymond, and ended up having a reunion tour which later brought the band back for good, with newly hired American guitarist Vinnie Moore. The band then released several new albums : Showtime, You Are Here, The Monkey Puzzle, The Visitor, Seven Deadly and A Conspiracy of Stars.
Mogg is the only member of UFO to appear on all of the band's albums.
He is the uncle of Nigel Mogg, bassist with The Quireboys.
Phil Mogg was a junior boxing champion in the North London area before turning professional in music.
