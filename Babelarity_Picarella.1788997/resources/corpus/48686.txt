The flag of the state of Nebraska is a blue rectangular cloth charged with the Nebraskan state seal. The current design was adopted in 1925, although a design in 1921 from an architect based in the U.S. state of New York was rejected by the Nebraskan state government. The official designation of the design as the state flag occurred in 1963; Nebraska was one of the last states to adopt an official flag.
The Nebraskan flag was rated in a survey by the North American Vexillological Association as 71st out of 72 U.S. and Canadian flags, making it the second-worst flag in the survey. The worst-ranked flag, the flag of Georgia at the time, was temporary and has since been changed. In 2002, the Nebraska Legislature's Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee discussed a bill that would have created a commission that would suggest new flag designs to the Legislature. The flag was not changed.
