Bones Inc. (株式会社 ボンズ, Kabushiki Kaisha Bonzu), often romanized as BONES in Japan, is a Japanese anime studio. It has produced numerous series, including RahXephon, Wolf's Rain, Scrapped Princess, Eureka Seven, Angelic Layer, Darker than Black, Soul Eater, Ouran High School Host Club and two adaptions of the Fullmetal Alchemist manga along with Star Driver, Gosick, and Space Dandy. Its headquarters is located in Igusa, Suginami, Tokyo.
Bones was founded by Sunrise staff members Masahiko Minami, Hiroshi Ōsaka and Toshihiro Kawamoto in October, 1998. One of their first projects was collaborating with Sunrise on Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door, a feature film based on the Cowboy Bebop anime series.
In 2007, the studio suffered the loss of co-founder Hiroshi Ōsaka, well known for his works as character designer on series such as Mobile Suit Victory Gundam, Mobile Fighter G Gundam and The Mars Daybreak. Ōsaka had been battling with cancer, and died from the disease on September 24, 2007. He was 44 years old.
Since the death of Hiroshi Ōsaka, two new additions have been made to the studio's board of directors. The additions are Makoto Watanabe and Takahiro Komori. Takahiro Komori is well known as a character designer and animator who has been with the studio since their inception. His previous works as designer consist of Angelic Layer, Scrapped Princess, and Darker than Black.
