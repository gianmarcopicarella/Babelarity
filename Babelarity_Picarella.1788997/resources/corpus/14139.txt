The 1967 Canadian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Mosport Park in Bowmanville, Ontario, Canada on August 27, 1967. The 90-lap race was the eighth round of the 1967 Formula One season and was won by Jack Brabham driving for his own Brabham team. This was the first Canadian Grand Prix held in the Formula One Championship.
Having already changed his battery on the grid, losing six laps, Al Pease spun and stalled out on the circuit during the race, and suffered another flat battery. He ran back to the pits for a new one, ran back to the car, fitted the battery himself and continued. He was still running at the finish, albeit 43 laps down on the winner.
Eppie Wietzes was disqualified after attempting to receive outside assistance whilst suffering an ignition failure. He was driving a factory Lotus 49, but qualified 17th (16th due to Siffert's withdrawal) and was 8.4 seconds off Jim Clark's pace.
Jo Siffert qualified 13th, but was unable to start his car on the grid, and withdrew from the event.
Last podium finish for Dan Gurney and his team, Eagle.
Notes: Only the top five positions are included for both sets of standings.
