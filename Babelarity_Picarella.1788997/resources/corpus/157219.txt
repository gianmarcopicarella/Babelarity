Cherokee first settled the area of what is today the city of Anderson. During the American Revolution the Cherokee sided with the British. After the American Revolutionary War the Cherokee surrendered their land. In 1791 the South Carolina legislature created the Washington District which comprised Greenville, Anderson, Oconee and Pickens counties. The Washington District was then divided into Greenville and Pendleton districts. Anderson, Pickens and Oconee comprised the newly created Pendleton district. Anderson was settled in 1826 and incorporated in 1828 as Anderson Court House separating from the Pendleton district. The name Anderson is in honor of Robert Anderson who fought in the American Revolutionary War and also explored the Anderson region in the mid-17th century. Anderson County was also established in 1826 out of the Pendleton district. Anderson became one of the first cities in the Southeastern United States to have electricity. Electricity to Anderson was provided by a hydroelectric plant at High Shoals on the Rocky River built in 1895 giving the city the name "The Electric City." In 1895 Anderson Court House was renamed to Anderson.
