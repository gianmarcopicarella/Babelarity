Hassan Shehata (Egyptian Arabic: حسـن شحـاتة) (born 19 June 1949), nicknamed The Teacher (Egyptian: El Me'alem), is an Egyptian football coach and former player.
He played for Zamalek FC and was given the award for Best Player in Asia in 1970.
In 2004, Shehata became Egyptian national team coach after the sacking of Italian coach Marco Tardelli. In the 2006 African Cup of Nations, which was hosted by Egypt, he led the team to its first Cup of Nations in eight years, defeating the Ivory Coast in the final.
During the African Cup semi-final against Senegal, Shehata had a serious row with Mido, when Mido reacted badly to being substituted. Shehata was vindicated minutes later when Amr Zaki, the player replacing Mido, scored the winning goal which took Egypt to the final. Shehata did allow Mido to accept his medal at the closing ceremonies of the African Cup of Nations, after Mido had made a public apology a few days before.
He led Egypt to three successive titles at the African Cup of Nations in 2006, 2008 and 2010. He thus became the second coach to win the trophy three times (a record) after Ghana's Charles Gyamfi, and the only one to win three consecutive cups. Egypt became the first African nation to achieve this streak/record. As a result of this, the Egyptian team were ranked as high as 9th in the FIFA World Rankings. In 2008, he was awarded the title of CAF Coach of the Year.
In 2010, he was the highest ranked African Coach as ranked by the IFFHS. He was also selected as one of the top five African coaches.
In 2015, he became President of The SATUC Cup, a new charitable global football competition for U16 orphans, refugees and disadvantaged children.
