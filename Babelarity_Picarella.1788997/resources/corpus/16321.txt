Sailing at the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics was held from August 18 to August 23. The events took place at Jinniu Lake in Nanjing, China.
Each National Olympic Committee (NOC) can enter a maximum of 4 boats, 1 per each event. As hosts, China was expected to be given the maximum quota, but since they did not compete in the qualification events the spots were reallocated. An extra additional spot was created in girls' techno 293 and was given to China. A further 8, 2 in each event will be decided by the Tripartite Commission. The remaining 88 places shall be decided by qualification events, namely the 2013 World Championships and six continental qualification tournaments for each boat. Should a country decline a spot or spots remain unfilled after the qualification event the quota will be reallocated to another nation with priority going to nations that have not qualified to any sailing events.
To be eligible to participate at the Youth Olympics athletes must have been born between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 1999.
