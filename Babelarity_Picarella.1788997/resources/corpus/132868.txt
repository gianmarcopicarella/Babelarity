Mammisi (Mamisi) is a term used for a small chapel attached to a larger temple, and associated with the nativity of a god. The word is derived from Coptic. Its usage is attributed to Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion. The most important surviving examples are from the Ptolemaic and Roman periods in Egypt.
