Claude Puel (born 2 September 1961 in Castres) is a French football manager and former player who is the current manager of Premier League club Southampton. He spent 17 years playing for AS Monaco.
Puel started his football career as a youth with Castres FC, where he was spotted by AS Monaco, joining their training centre in 1977. He played his first professional game in the 1979–80 season. He spent his entire career at Monaco, playing 601 official matches in total. During his time at Monaco, he won two championships and three French Cups.
Before being annointed as the manager of Monaco, he was the physical trainer and manager of the Monaco's reserve team. He was appointed as the manager in January 1999. He won the French Championship in 2000, with players, such as Ludovic Giuly and Marcelo Gallardo. In July 2001, his contract was not renewed and he left Monaco after 24 years at the club as a player and a coach.
In July 2002, he was appointed manager of Lille, where he became one of the longest serving coaches in the French League (serving for six consecutive seasons). Puel courted controversy on 20 February 2007 in a UEFA Champions League match against Manchester United in Lille. After Ryan Giggs scored a quickly taken free-kick late in the game, Puel was thought to be encouraging his players to walk off the pitch in protest, although the game eventually continued after a short delay. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson described the incident in an interview with ITV after the match as 'disgraceful' and 'intimidation of the referee'". He's a young guy so he will learn to hold it down soon. Hopefully he doesn't learn the hard way."
Puel joined French club Olympique Lyonnais on 18 June 2008. He signed a four-year contract with the seven time French champions. He also became Lyon's 4th different manager in the last 4 years. In 2010 he helped the club reach the semi-final of the Champions League for the first time in its history. Lyon terminated his contract on 20 June 2011, although he had one year remaining on his contract with the club.
On 23 May 2012, Puel reached agreement on a three-year deal with OGC Nice to take a coaching job.
On 30 June 2016, Puel was appointed the manager of Southampton on a three-year deal.
