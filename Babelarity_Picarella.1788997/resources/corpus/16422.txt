The Royal Kituro Avia Schaerbeek Rugby Club, often shortened Kituro RC, is a Belgian rugby union club currently competing in the Belgian Elite League.
The club is based in Schaerbeek, a suburb to Brussels. The official colours of the club are green and black. The Kituro is a 50-year-old rugby club; one of the most successful and best known in Belgium with more than 560 players from U7 to U19, Seniors, Veterans, Ladies and a Touch Team.
It benefits from the best quality rugby ground in Belgium with its two new synthetic pitches (International IRB Standards), six changing rooms and a friendly and very comfortable club house.
The club is located in Brussels alongside the Boulevard LÃ©opold III (Zaventem airport highway) between NATO and the EU Schuman area.
The club was founded in 1961 by international referee Teddy Lacroix along with Volcanologist and Rugby Player Haroun Tazieff who choose to name the club after Mount Kituro in the former Belgian Colony of Congo. The club was donated land by the City Of Brussels and quickly established itself as a major force in Belgian Rugby. The heir to the Belgian Throne Prince Philippe, Duke of Brabant played for the team.
Kituro has won the Belgian Elite League title on five occasions and most recently in May 2015.
