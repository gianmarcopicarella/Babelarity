A Ship Bound for India (Swedish: Skepp till Indialand) is a 1947 Swedish film directed by Ingmar Bergman. It was originally released as A Ship to India in the United Kingdom and Frustration in the United States. The screenplay was written by Bergman, based on the play by Martin Söderhjelm.
The film tells the story of the past of the character Johannes, and his relationships with his cruel father, his mother, and his father's mistress with whom Johannes falls in love.
The movie contains sequences of despair and anguish. Birger Malmsten, who plays the lead character Johannes and who will be seen in several later Bergman films, is immensely likable and compelling as the hunchback son who finally stands up to his despotic father.
The film is about the relationships within a family, a subject with which Bergman often dealt in later films, and uses other common devices of Bergman such as the hard father figure.
The film was entered into the 1947 Cannes Film Festival.
