Harrodsburg is a home rule-class city in Mercer County, Kentucky, in the United States. It is the seat of its county. The population was 8,340 at the 2010 census.
Although Harrodsburg was formally established by the House of Burgesses after Boonesborough and was not incorporated by the Kentucky legislature until 1836, it is usually considered the oldest city in Kentucky and has been honored as the oldest permanent American settlement west of the Appalachians.
Harrodstown (sometimes Harrod's Town) was laid out and founded by its namesake James Harrod on June 16, 1774. Amid Dunmore's War, the settlement was abandoned later the same year as a result of Native American attacks, but it was resettled a year later in 1775. Fear of attacks from the Native Americans during the American Revolutionary War left it one of only three settlements in Kentucky after 1777, along with Logan's Fort and Boonesborough. Also known as Oldtown, Harrodstown was the first seat of Virginia's Kentucky (1776), Lincoln (1780), and Mercer (1785) counties upon their formations. It remains the seat of Mercer County in Kentucky.
The settlement was formally established by the Virginia legislature in 1785 as Harrodsburg. In 1789, it was named the location of the Kentucky Federal District Court. The Kentucky legislature incorporated Harrodsburg in 1836.
During the Civil War, the town was pro-Confederate but Union control permitted the organization of the 19th Regiment Kentucky Volunteer Infantry at nearby Camp Harwood for a three-year enlistment commencing January 2, 1862, under the command of Col. William J. Landram. Following the Battle of Perryville, much of the city was converted into makeshift hospitals; 1600 sick and wounded Confederate soldiers were captured during a raid by the 9th Kentucky Cavalry under Lt Col. John Boyle on October 10, 1862. The city then remained under martial law for the remainder of the war.
The Louisville Southern Railroad (LS) network reached the city in 1888. Louisville Southern Railway's construction commenced in 1884 and ran from Louisville through Shelbyville and Lawrenceburg to Harrodsburg, which was reached in 1888. A spur was constructed to Burgin, where the Louisville Southern joined the Cincinnati Southern's Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific Railway CNO&TP mainline. Now all run and operated by Norfolk Southern Railway.
Pioneer Memorial Park (now Old Fort Harrod State Park) was opened on June 16, 1927. In 1936, Pres. Franklin Delano Roosevelt honored the city with a monument honoring the 'first permanent settlement west of the Appalachians'.
Company D of the 192nd Tank Battalion in the Battle of Bataan was from Harrodsburg.
