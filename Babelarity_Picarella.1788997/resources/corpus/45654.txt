Endless Pain is the debut studio album by German thrash metal band Kreator, released in October 1985 by Noise Records.
On this album both Petrozza and Reil share vocal duties. This album has been known to be viewed as a pivotal album to black metal bands that enjoy dabbling in thrash metal elements, ultimately creating a thrash-influenced black metal sound.
All songs by Fioretti, Petrozza and Reil.
The 1989 CD reissue from Noise Records included the two original tracks from the Flag of Hate EP, "Take Their Lives" and "Awakening of the Gods", as well as the replacing "Flag of Hate" with the re-recorded version from that EP.
