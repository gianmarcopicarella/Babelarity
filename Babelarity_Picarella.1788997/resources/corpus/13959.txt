John Stones (born 28 May 1994) is an English professional footballer who plays for Premier League club Everton and the England national team. Mainly a centre-back, he can also play as a right-back.
He began his career with Barnsley, making his professional debut in the Championship in March 2012, before joining Everton for around £3 million in January 2013.
Stones made his senior debut for England in 2014 and was selected for UEFA Euro 2016.
Born in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, Stones came through the Barnsley youth academy to sign professional forms in December 2011. He made his professional debut in the Championship on 17 March 2012, in a 0–4 defeat to Reading at Oakwell, replacing Scott Wiseman after 52 minutes. He scored his only goal for Barnsley on his first start, equalising before half time in a League Cup first round match away to Rochdale on 11 August 2012, which resulted in a 4–3 victory after extra time. A week later, he made his first league start, in a 1–0 victory against Middlesbrough.
Stones signed a five-and-a-half-year deal with Everton on 31 January 2013, for a transfer fee reported to be in the region of £3 million. He was an unused substitute for three Premier League matches that season, beginning on 10 February in a 0–2 defeat to Manchester United at Old Trafford.
He made his debut for Everton against Stevenage in the League Cup second round on 28 August 2013, a 2–1 win after extra time at Goodison Park. He made his league debut as a late substitute for Steven Naismith in a 1–0 home win over Chelsea on 14 September 2013. He started his first Premier League game for Everton in a 1–1 draw against Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium on 1 January 2014.
On 7 August 2014, Stones signed a new five-year contract to keep him with Everton until 2019. The deal was believed to be worth around £30,000 a week. He suffered an ankle injury against Manchester United on 5 October, ruling him out for between 10 and 14 weeks. Despite the injury, Stones was listed among the nominees for the Golden Boy 2014 Award alongside fellow Everton winger Gerard Deulofeu and fellow England internationals Calum Chambers, Luke Shaw and eventual winner Raheem Sterling.
Stones was sent off in Everton's 4–1 away win at Young Boys in the last 32 of the UEFA Europa League on 19 February 2015, for conceding a penalty with a foul on Guillaume Hoarau, who went on to miss the spot-kick. He scored his first goal for Everton in a 3–0 home win against Manchester United on 26 April 2015, heading in the team's second goal of the game.
In July and August 2015, Stones was reportedly the subject of three bids from Chelsea – of £20 million, £26 million and £30 million – all of which were rejected by Everton. Stones was reported to have handed in a request to leave Everton, but this was also refused.
On 28 December, Stones fouled Stoke City's Marko Arnautović in added time at the end of a home match, conceding a penalty kick from which the same player scored the winning goal in a 4–3 victory.
Stones was named in manager Peter Taylor's 21-man squad for the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup in May 2013. He made his England U20 debut on 16 June, in a 3–0 win in a warm-up game against Uruguay. He made his under-21s debut against Scotland's U21s. He played the entire 90 minutes of a 6–0 win for England.
He was named as a standby player for England's 2014 FIFA World Cup squad, but was not included in the final squad. Stones made his England debut on 30 May in a 3–0 friendly win over Peru at Wembley, replacing Everton teammate Leighton Baines for the final 15 minutes, also playing the next match, a 2–2 draw with Ecuador. On 3 September 2014, Stones made his first England start in a friendly against Norway at Wembley Stadium. Five days later, in England's first match of UEFA Euro 2016 qualification, Stones made his competitive debut in a 2–0 victory away to Switzerland at St. Jakob-Park, Basel.
