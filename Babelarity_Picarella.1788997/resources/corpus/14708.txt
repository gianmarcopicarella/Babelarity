Ezequiel Mosquera Míguez (born 19 November 1975) is a Spanish former road bicycle racer. He has finished in the top 5 of the Vuelta a España in all appearances, and finished second in 2010, after putting in a strong time trial and winning the penultimate stage to Bola del Mundo. After testing positive for hydroxyethyl starch in the race, he was suspended by the UCI and his results from the 2010 Vuelta were annulled.
In the 2010 Vuelta a España, Mosquera initially finished in second place, riding for Xacobeo–Galicia.
After that, he signed a contract with Vacansoleil–DCM to ride for them in 2011.
On September 30, 2010 UCI reported that Mosquera and his team-mate David García Dapena tested positive for hydroxyethyl starch during the 2010 Vuelta. Hydroxyethyl starch is associated with endurance athletes trying to cover up erythropoietin usage.
His new team Vacansoleil–DCM did not allow him to ride while he was still under investigation. In April 2011, the Union Cycliste Internationale sent his dossier to the Spanish cycling authorities, who opened their own investigation in July, and suspended Mosquera in November. He was suspended for two years, not counting the 2011 season where he did not ride. Vacansoleil–DCM fired him after his suspension became official. All results from Mosquera after 12 September 2010 – stage 15 of the Vuelta a España– were annulled.
