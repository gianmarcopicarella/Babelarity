Mohammed Salim Basindawa (Arabic: محمد سالم باسندوة‎‎ born 4 April 1935) is a Yemeni politician who was Prime Minister of Yemen from 10 December 2011 to 21 September 2014.
Born in Aden, Basindawa served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1993 to 1994. He was a member of Yemen's ruling party, but resigned in the early 2000s to join the opposition to President Ali Abdullah Saleh as an independent.
In November 2011, following months of unrest, Basindawa was nominated by the Yemeni opposition to lead the first government after the ouster of President Saleh. On 27 November 2011, he was named Prime Minister by Vice President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Al-Hadi. He and the members of his cabinet were sworn in on 10 December 2011.
On 31 August 2013 Basindawa narrowly escaped an assassination attempt when gunmen opened fire on his convoy.
On 21 September 2014, Basindawa resigned as Prime Minister on the same day that Houthi rebels captured Sana'a, the capital of Yemen.
