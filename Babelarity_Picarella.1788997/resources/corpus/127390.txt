Ordubad is a name of Turco-Persian origin and means "city of army" (from Turkic ordu (army) and Persian bad (city)), which implies that the city was founded during the period of the Mongol or the ensuing Il-Khanid rule.
Ordubad region was a part of the khanates of Erivan and Nakhchivan, which were dependencies of Qajar empire, with Ordubad forming the main town of the district of Aza-Jeran in the eastern part of the khanate of Nakhchivan. After the Russo-Persian War and the Turkmanchay Treaty of 1828, the region was ceded to Imperial Russia, and became a part of Nakhchivan Uyezd of Erivan Governorate. Since 1921 Ordubad was a part of Nakhchivan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, which in 1990 became the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic within the Azerbaijan Republic.
