Antioch is a village in the Antioch Township of Lake County, Illinois, United States. The population was 14,430 at the 2010 census.
The Pottawatomi Indian Tribe, semi-nomadic hunters who lived in wigwams, inhabited Antioch when white men began to arrive. They fought with the British in the War of 1812 and then with the American settlers in the Blackhawk War of 1832. It was in 1832 that the American Indians began to leave the area, although arrowheads and other remnants of their history can still be found today if one knows where to look. The winding Highway 173 was once an Indian trail and Highway 83 was the Muquonago Trail.
The first permanent white settlement in Antioch was the Gage Brothers' cabin on Sequoit Creek, a tributary of the Fox River. In 1839, Hiram Buttrick built a sawmill along the creek, making Antioch a center of commerce. A replica of the mill has been built a few hundred feet downstream from where it once stood.
The influence of the Gage brothers is important when trying to understand the history and names of the Antioch area, as many local businesses, as well as ACHS sports teams, bear the word "Sequoit." There is no Native American tribe named "Sequoit" or any Native American word for that matter stemming from Antioch's Pottawatomi inhabitants. Though the word "sequoit" has Native American origins, the story behind the name is as complicated as it is historically interesting. Fred Willman explains in his in-depth book examining Illinois high school nicknames, "Why Mascots Have Tales", "The word Sequoit is a form of spelling of the Iroquois Indian word Sa-da-quoit, which was the name the Iroquois Indians gave to a stream that flows through Oneida County in New York state. In the Iroquois language, Sa-da-quoit literally means ‘smooth pebbles in the bed of a stream.’ When white settlers moved into Oneida County, they modified the spelling and pronunciation of the stream to Sequoit Creek." This was later transplanted and modified when the Gage brothers moved from New York State to northern Illinois.
Antioch was officially founded just prior to the Civil War by a congregation of the Disciples of Christ, also known as the Church of Christ. In 1843, less enthusiastically religious residents mockingly recommended the Christian name "Antioch" (the name of a city in present-day Turkey that was a chief center of early Christianity), and the name stuck. Partly due to being a regional center of the abolitionist movement, Antioch is noted as having sent a disproportionately high number of its young men to the Union Army. Shortly after the Civil War, the town disincorporated, as many of the initial religious settlers moved away.
In 1892, Antioch reincorporated as a village, which it has been continuous to this day. The town grew as new settlers (primarily of English and German descent) established farms and businesses.
In the late 1800s, Antioch became a popular vacation spot for Chicagoans. Tourism grew quickly once the rail line to Chicago was laid in 1886. Originally, farmers near the lake accepted boarders, then they added guest rooms onto their homes. Eventually hotels and subdivisions of summer cottages were built. The tourists took excursion boats through the renowned flowering lotus beds. Hunting, fishing, dancing and gambling were big draws, but most tourists (not to mention year-round residents) simply preferred the quiet country life over the hustle and bustle of Chicago. During Prohibition, one famous Antioch resident was Al Capone, who owned a summer home on nearby Bluff Lake.
Fire destroyed much of downtown in 1891, 1903, and 1904. What remained was a little-known cottage, titled "Steve's Cottage", on what is commonly called "Loon Lake." In 1905, the town rebuilt with brick and started a public water system. The base of the first water tower is still found at the corner of Toft and Orchard Streets. A volunteer Fire Department was formed in 1913.
The town grew at a steady pace through the years. Harvesting ice to supply iceboxes was a major industry in the area for many years. Pickard China, a manufacturer of fine china, has been a steady employer in Antioch since 1937. In the 1950s, the village developed a large industrial park along Anita Avenue, which greatly contributes to the tax and employment base.

Most of Antioch's residents work outside of the village, in Chicago or neighboring villages. Residents can reach both Chicago and Milwaukee by way of Interstate 94 and U.S. Route 41. Since 1996, Metra's North Central Service has played an increasingly important role in the development of Antioch. Weekday train service to and from Chicago appeals to many commuters and has given rise to new commercial development near the train depot. The village is currently undergoing rapid commercial and residential growth, with a majority of it along the Illinois Route 173 corridor. One of the last remaining operating Dairy Farms in Lake County also resides near much of the residential growth on Route 173 in Antioch. There was once over 1,700 farms, over four hundred which were dairy farms operating in the County in 1940. But this number has since been reduced to just 3 to 4 dairies still in operation and a little over 22,000 acres (90 km2) of harvested corn and soybeans left in the County. Glenraven Farms resides just west of Highway 45 on Route 173 on 325 acres (1.3 km2) and has been in constant operation since the early 1950s. Golden Oaks Farms which bordered the property into the late 90's and was also a Dairy Farm was bought by the Lake County Forest Preserve and turned into a park and conservation area.
The village has some small industry. Manufacturers in Antioch include the world famous Pickard China factory, which makes fine china for Air Force One and Camp David, and Fischer Paper Products, which produces pinch bottom bags and other packaging products. Downtown Antioch has a mix of small retailers focused on antiques, quilting, small clothing boutiques and a variety of ethnic restaurants.
During the 2000s Antioch experienced extensive commercial development – in addition to the establishment of branches of chain restaurants such as Culvers, Popeyes, and Arbys, and a CVS Pharmacy store during the mid-2000s a new commercial center was established on the outskirts of Antioch which includes, among others, a Wal-Mart shopping center and a Menards home improvement store. Later, in 2015, a new Sleepy's mattress store was added. Also, a Walgreens on Main St, was moved across Illinois Rte 83, was completely rebuilt, and now is on the upper right corner of the Illinois Rte 83, and Illinois Rte 173 intersection.
According to Antioch's 2010 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the village were:

The fire department currently uses 3 fire stations to house its different equipment, although currently only Station #1 in the downtown area is staffed 24/7 with part-time personnel. Antioch Fire Department has a vast array of equipment to use including several engines, a tower ladder truck, 2 water tenders, 2 boats including an air boat, and a six-wheeled vehicle to access hard to reach areas. Antioch Fire Dept. also owns several pieces of special equipment including new state of the art extrication equipment used to extricate injured people from wrecked cars. The Antioch First Fire Protection District was the first organized fire protection district in the state. The Fire Department also has an Explorer post for youths ages 15 to 20 interested in making the fire service a career.
A volunteer rescue squad provides 9-1-1 ambulance service to the community. The Antioch Rescue Squad was the first Advanced Life Support (ALS) licensed rescue squad in the state, with the first licensed paramedics in the State of Illinois. Currently, the Antioch Rescue Squad maintains a fleet of 4 ALS ambulances and 4 non transport vehicles and is the sole 9-1-1 ambulance service provider for the Antioch community. The Antioch Rescue Squad operates out of the north side of Antioch Fire Station 1 which is located in downtown Antioch. Rescue squad paramedics also staff Antioch Fire Station 2 (located on Deep Lake Rd) with an ambulance crew 24/7.
The police department and the fire department are housed in separate buildings next to each other. The Antioch Village Board elected to close the communication center in 2012, electing to outsource all of its 911 emergency dispatch service (Police, Fire, and Rescue) to another center located in Round Lake Beach. In March 1993, the Antioch Police Department became a part of the Lake County Enhanced 911 system.

The Antioch Public Library began as an Antioch Women's Club project in 1921. Initially the Women's Club raised funds for the establishment of a village library and the residents donated books for the library. This first village library was located at 934 Main Street and was open only two days a week. In 1922 the library was moved to the Antioch Village Hall at 875 Main Street. In 1930 the library was moved again to the corner of Main Street and Depot Street. In 1941, the Library was moved again to 883 Main Street. In 1950 William Schroeder family donated the property located at 757 Main Street to the Village of Antioch for use as a library. The new library building was officially opened in 1970. In August 2001 construction began of an 18,000-square-foot addition to the Antioch Public Library facility. The construction was completed in January 2003.
The Chain O'Lakes found along the Fox River, serves as an aquatic mecca for boating and summer leisure while skiing and snowmobiling abound during the winter months. Along with neighboring Fox Lake, Antioch has become host to numerous pro and amateur national fishing tournaments. For instance, on Loon Lake every July, fishers from all over the world try to catch the elusive "Batman fish".
The "Batman Fish" has been a legend ever since Forest Lithgard claimed to have discovered a new breed of fish with a brownish pattern resembling the Batman symbol. The Batman fish is believed to have been imported by Lithgard, who claimed to have caught the fish near the Malay Archipelago. Marine biologist Dr. McBunty disputes this, pointing out that the dark brown markings indicate a species native to the Atlantic Ocean.
Kite flying is also a popular sporting event on Loon Lake during Labor Day Weekend. Currently, the Swiss Kiting Federation holds the record for the longest kite flight of 1 hour and 24 minutes.
The village is bordered by four holdings of the Lake County Forest Preserve District, an award winning and nationally recognized land conservation organization.
There is currently a thriving performing arts scene, centered around the PM&L Theatre as well as the civic bandstand behind Main Street.
