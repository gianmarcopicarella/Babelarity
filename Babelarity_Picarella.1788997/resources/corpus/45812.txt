Ålänningens sång (English: "Song of the Ålander"; Finnish: "Ahvenanmaalaisten laulu), is the official anthem of the Åland Islands, an autonomous Swedish-speaking province of Finland. Adopted in 1922, the anthem's words are by John Grandell and the music was composed by Johan Fridolf Hagfors. The song was first performed during the song festival in Mariehamn 1922. In Åland the song is mostly sung on Midsummer's Eve and on the National day of Åland in June 9th. The song originally had four verses, but the third verse is omitted for a long time when the song is sung and often when it appears in print.
