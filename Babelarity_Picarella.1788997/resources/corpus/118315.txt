330 Adalberta, provisional designation A910 CB, is a stony asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, about 10 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by German astronomer Max Wolf at Heidelberg Observatory in southern Germany, on 2 February 1910.
The S-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.8–3.1 AU once every 3 years and 11 months (1,417 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.25 and is tilted by 7 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. In 2013, a photometric light-curve analysis performed at Los Algarrobos Observatory (I38), Uruguay, rendered a rotation period of 7000355530000000000♠3.5553±0.0001 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.44 in magnitude. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes that the asteroid's surface has a albedo of 0.20, which is a typical value for stony bodies.
Previously, on 18 March 1892, another body discovered by Max Wolf with the provisional designation 1892 X was originally named 330 Adalberta, but was lost and never recovered (also see Lost minor planet). In 1982, it was determined that Wolf erroneously measured two images of stars, not asteroids. As it was a false positive and the body never existed, the name and number "330 Adalberta" was then reused for this asteroid, A910 CB.
The minor planet was named in honor of the discoverer's father-in-law, Adalbert Merx (after whom another minor planet 808 Merxia is also named), or, possibly, for Adalbert Krüger (1832–1896), German astronomer and editor of the Astronomische Nachrichten, one of the first international journals in the field of astronomy.
