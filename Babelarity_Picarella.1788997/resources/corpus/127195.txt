Pierre Jeanneret (2 March 1896 â€“ 4 December 1967) was a Swiss architect who collaborated with his cousin, Charles Edouard Jeanneret (who assumed the pseudonym Le Corbusier), for about twenty years.
Arnold Andre Pierre Jeanneret-Gris was born in Geneva. He attended the School of Fine Arts (Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Geneva). He was a cyclist in the Swiss Army from 1916 to 1918.
In 1922, the Jeanneret cousins set up an architectural practice together. They designed many buildings, including a number of villas and vacation houses, and renovated existing buildings as well.
Their working relationship ended when Pierre joined the French Resistance and Le Corbusier did not. However, they collaborated once again after the War, on the plan and architecture for the planned city of Chandigarh in India.
Jeanneret, in collaboration with the English husband-wife team of Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew, was responsible for much of Chandigarh's large civic architecture project. Jeanneret was responsible for a significant amount of designing for the Panjab University, including the Gandhi Bhawan and the University Library.
Jeanneret stayed on in Chandigarh after its construction, advising the local government in his appointed capacity as Chief Architect of the city.
As well as buildings, Jeanneret also designed furniture, both independently and with Le Corbusier. He experimented with minimalist design, including a chair which required no fasteners.
On his death, 4 December 1967, in accordance with his will, Jeanneret's ashes were scattered in Chandigarh's Sukhna Lake.
