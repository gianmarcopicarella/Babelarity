At the 1906 Summer Olympics, called "Intercalated Games", in Athens, an unofficial football event was contested. Only four teams competed, three of them clubs from Greece and the Ottoman Empire. Some medal tables give the gold to Denmark and the silver and bronze to Turkey.
The Athens team withdrew from the final at half time to preserve their dignity, and were then invited to play off in a match to decide second place, but declined and were promptly ejected from the tournament.
Smyrna and Thessaloniki, both then cities in the Ottoman Empire, played off instead. The Thessaloniki team composition was Greek from the group of "Friends of the Arts" (Omilos Philomuson, later Iraklis Thessaloniki F.C.). The Smyrna team consisted of English, French and Armenian players.
The Danish team was a selection of players from Copenhagen Football Association.
The goalscorers of this tournament are unknown.
