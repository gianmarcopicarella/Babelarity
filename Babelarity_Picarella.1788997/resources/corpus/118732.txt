1772 Gagarin, provisional designation 1968 CB, is a stony asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, about 9 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Russian female astronomer Lyudmila Chernykh at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory in Nauchnyj on 6 February 1968.
The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.3–2.8 AU once every 4 years and 7 days (1,467 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.11 and is tilted by 6 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. The asteroid has a rotation period of 10.9 hours and an albedo of 0.14 based on preliminary results from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer space telescope. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a somewhat higher albedo of 0.20 according to is classification as a S-type asteroid.
The minor planet is named after Russian–Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin (1934–1968), Hero of the Soviet Union and first human to journey into outer space by circumnavigating Earth in 1961. Gagarin died in a jet fighter crash in 1968, the year the asteroid was discovered. The lunar crater Gagarin is also named in his honor.
