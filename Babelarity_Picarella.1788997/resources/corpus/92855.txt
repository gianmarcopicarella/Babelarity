Bucephala is a genus of ducks found in the Northern Hemisphere. The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek boukephalos, "bullheaded", from bous "bull", and kephale, "head", a reference to the crest of the bufflehead making its head look large.
The bufflehead was formerly separated in its own genus Charitonetta, while the goldeneyes proper were mistakenly placed in Clangula (as Clangula americana), the genus of the long-tailed duck, which at that time was placed in Harelda.
The three living species are:
Common goldeneye (Bucephala clangula)
Barrow's goldeneye (Bucephala islandica)
Bufflehead (Bucephala albeola)
Known fossil taxa are:
Bucephala cereti (Sajóvölgyi Middle Miocene of Mátraszõlõs, Hungary - Late Pliocene of Chilhac, France)
Bucephala ossivalis (Late Miocene/Early Pliocene of Bone Valley, United States), which was very similar to the common goldeneye and may even have been a paleosubspecies or direct ancestor
Bucephala fossilis (Late Pliocene of California, United States)
Bucephala angustipes (Early Pleistocene of central Europe)
Bucephala sp. (Early Pleistocene of Dursunlu, Turkey: Louchart et al. 1998)
