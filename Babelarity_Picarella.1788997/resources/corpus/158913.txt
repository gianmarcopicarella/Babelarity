Russell County is a county located in the Commonwealth of Virginia. As of the 2010 census, the population was 28,897. Its county seat is Lebanon.
On January 2, 1786, Russell County was established from a section of Washington County. L.P. Summers, a Washington County historian later wrote, "Washington County lost a great extent of country and many valuable citizens when Russell County was formed." The county was named for Culpeper County native Colonel William Russell. The first court met in May 1786 in the Castle's Woods settlement (present-day Castlewood) in the house of William Robinson. Later, a new place was built to house the County Seat. The structure used as a courthouse still stands, and is referred to as "The Old Courthouse." The present Courthouse, located in Lebanon, has been in use since 1874.
The County has been home for many well known persons such as Daniel Boone, Governor H.C. Stuart, State Representative Boyd C. Fugate and State Senator M.M. Long. Russell County was also the birthplace of other counties. The counties of Wise, Lee, Tazewell, and Scott were formed from parts of Russell County.
The largest cattle farm East of the Mississippi River is headquartered at Rosedale in Russell County.
