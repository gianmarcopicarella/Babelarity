Iž (pronounced [îːʒ]; Italian: Eso, German: Ese) is an island in the Zadar Archipelago within the Croatian reaches of the Adriatic Sea. It is situated between Ugljan on the north-east and Dugi Otok on the south-west and is about an hour's ferry ride from Zadar. It has an area of 17.59 square kilometres (7 square miles) and a population of 615 (2011). Its mineralogy is composed of mainly limestone and dolomite. The island has been settled since prehistoric times; there is a Catholic church dating from the 11th century and records of the first Croatian settlers date from the year 1266. Its two biggest settlements (Iž Veli and Iž Mali) are located on the eastern part of the island.
Near the island there are some very small uninhabited islands: Knežak, Rutnjak and Fulija for example. In the Iž dialect people almost never say f, they use h instead. Main activities are sailing, fishing, olive cultivation and pottery. The island is very popular amongst foreign tourists, largely due to its great beaches.
