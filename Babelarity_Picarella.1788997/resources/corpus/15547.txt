The 2004 Wimbledon Championships were held between 21 June – 4 July 2004.
Roger Federer was successful in his title defence, defeating Andy Roddick in the final to win his second Wimbledon title. Two-time defending champion Serena Williams was unsuccessful in her title defence, being upset in the final by then little-known 17-year-old Russian Maria Sharapova in the final; Sharapova became the first Russian player, male or female, to win Wimbledon, the second-youngest player to win Wimbledon in the open era and third youngest overall.
In the juniors, Gaël Monfils won his third consecutive Grand Slam title in the boys' competition, and Kateryna Bondarenko won the girls' title.
