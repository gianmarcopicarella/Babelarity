Kinetic theory may refer to:
Kinetic theory of gases, an account of gas properties in terms of motion and interaction of microscopic particles
Phonons, explaining properties of solids in terms of quantal collective motions and interactions of microscopic particles
Kinematics, the part of mechanics that describes the motion of points, particles, bodies, and systems of bodies, without reference to the forces, energies and interactions that govern their motion
