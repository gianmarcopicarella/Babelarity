Charles-Marie Vanel, known as Charles Vanel (21 August 1892 – 15 April 1989) was a French actor and director. He made his screen debut in 1912, in Robert Péguy's Jim Crow, and is perhaps best remembered for his role as a desperate truck driver in Clouzot's acclaimed The Wages of Fear, a film that won both the Golden Bear and Palme d'Or in 1953.
In Hitchcock's 1955 film, To Catch a Thief, he played a restaurateur who had served in the French Resistance with Cary Grant. Later in his career he would act alongside Jean-Paul Belmondo (Magnet of Doom) and Klaus Kinski (Golden Night).
In his 77-year career he appeared in more than 200 films.
