The olive ibis (Bostrychia olivacea) is a species of bird in the Threskiornithidae family. It is found in Cameroon, Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, São Tomé, Sierra Leone, Tanzania and Zambia. The São Tomé subspecies is sometimes recognised as a separate species, the São Tomé ibis, Bostrychia bocagei, with the mainland birds called the African olive ibis. There was some disagreement among ornithologists as to the order to which ibises belong and they were previously included in the Ciconiiformes. A recent study puts this species in the order Pelecaniformes.
