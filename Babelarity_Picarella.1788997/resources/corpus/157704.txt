In March 2006, Tuttle gained brief notoriety in some technical circles after former City Manager Jerry A. Taylor exchanged emails with CentOS developer Johnny Hughes, confused that a misconfiguration issue at the webhost provider was an attempt by CentOS to "hack" the City's website. In spite of attempts by Hughes to explain the cause of the issue and repeated requests for information needed to diagnose the problem, the conversation degenerated. Taylor threatened to call the FBI, and Hughes posted the conversation to the CentOS website as Taylor "welcome this publicity". The posting and its content stirred a global reaction in both Linux circles and media outlets.
In response to the media coverage of the incident, Taylor defended his actions and pointed out that his threats of FBI action were effective. “After that, he called me Mr. Taylor,” he said, “And he got me the information I needed.” In response to the derision he had received from the Open Source community, Taylor stated that those commenting about him online were "a bunch of freaks out there that don’t have anything better to do ... [CentOS is] a free operating system that this guy gives away, which tells you how much time he’s got on his hands."
