Xi Draconis (ξ Dra, ξ Draconis) is the Bayer designation for a star in the northern circumpolar constellation of Draco. It has the traditional name Grumium or Genam. This star, along with β Dra (Rastaban), γ Dra (Eltanin), μ Dra (Erakis) and ν Dra (Kuma) were Al ʽAwāïd, "the Mother Camels", which was later known as the Quinque Dromedarii. This star has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.75. Based upon parallax measurements, it is located at a distance of 112.5 light-years (34.5 parsecs) from Earth. At this distance, the apparent magnitude is diminished by 0.03 from extinction caused by intervening gas and dust.
In Chinese, 天棓 (Tiān Bàng), meaning Celestial Flail, refers to an asterism consisting of ξ Draconis, ν Draconis, β Draconis, γ Draconis and ι Herculis. Consequently, δ Draconis itself is known as 天棓一 (Tiān Bàng yī, English: the First Star of Celestial Flail.)
Xi Draconis is of spectral class K2-III.
USS Grumium (AK-112) was a United States Navy Crater class cargo ship named after the star.
