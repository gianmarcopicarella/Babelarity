Michel Leclère (born 18 March 1946 in Mantes-la-Jolie, Yvelines) is a former motor racing driver from France. He participated in eight Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on October 5, 1975, and scored no championship points.
After winning the French Formula 3 championship, driving for Alpine, in 1972, Leclère performed well in Formula 2. This earned him his chance in Formula One. After making his debut for Tyrrell at the last race of the 1975 season he landed a full-time drive with Wolf-Williams Racing in 1976. The relationship was not a success, however, and he returned to Formula 2. After a bad season with Kauhsen in 1978, he retired.
He has recently been involved with the Renault H&C Classic Team and has demonstrated and raced some of the historic Formula One cars and other machinery in their keeping, at various events around Europe.
