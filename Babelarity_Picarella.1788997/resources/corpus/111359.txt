Margaret of England (29 September 1240 – 26 February 1275) was Queen of Scots as the wife of King Alexander III.
Margaret was the second child of King Henry III of England and his wife, Eleanor of Provence, and was born at Windsor Castle. Margaret’s first appearance in historical record comes when she was three years old.
She was married on 26 December 1251, when she was 11 years old, at York Minster, to King Alexander III of Scotland, who was 10 years of age. The couple had three children:
Margaret (28 February 1261 – 9 April 1283), who married King Eric II of Norway.
Alexander (21 January 1264 Jedburgh – 28 January 1284 Lindores Abbey).
David (20 March 1272 – June 1281 Stirling Castle); buried in Dunfermline Abbey.
Margaret is said to have been unhappy in Scotland, and created some tensions between England and Scotland by writing to her family in England that she was poorly treated in Scotland.
It was said that Margaret was responsible for the death of a young courtier, who reputedly had killed her uncle Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester. While walking along the River Tay, she became annoyed with the young man. She jokingly pushed him into the river, but he was swept to his death by a powerful current before anyone could help.
Margaret died on 26 February 1275 at Cupar Castle, and was buried at Dunfermline Abbey, Fife.
