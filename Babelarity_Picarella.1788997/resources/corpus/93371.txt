The blue-eyes are a family of atheriniform fish, the Pseudomugilidae, related to the rainbowfishes. They inhabit fresh and brackish water in Australia and New Guinea. Blue-eyes are small fish, typically no more than 5 cm (2.0 in) in length. Like rainbowfish, they spawn all year round, and attach their eggs to vegetation.
