Tuscola County is a county located in the Thumb region of the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2010 census, the population was 55,729. The county seat is Caro. The county was created by Michigan Law on April 1, 1840, from land in Sanilac County and attached to Saginaw County for administrative purposes. The Michigan Legislature passed an act on March 2, 1850, that empowered the county residents to organize governmental functions.
Tuscola County is one of five counties that are in the Thumb area. Like the rest of the thumb, Tuscola County enjoys seasonal tourism from larger cities like Flint, Detroit and Saginaw.
The name Tuscola was a Neologism created by Henry Schoolcraft. One scholar believes it to be a combination of "dusinagon" (level) and "cola" (lands).
The Chippewa/Ottawa word "dusinagon", or "tessi-nagan", actually, means flat dish or plate. The early Chippewa/Ottawa often used a shell or bark from a tree for a dish or plate. Shell in their language was "essi", which may be the root of Tuscola. The Thumb of Michigan, which includes Tuscola, Huron, and Sanilac Counties, was in the 17th century called Skenchioe, which may be related to the Onondaga word "uschwuntschios", which means plain or flat. It was said that Skenchioe, the early home of the Fox People, meant red fox. The French in the early 18th century called the Thumb of Michigan Le Pays Plat, which means The Country Flat. This name was continued by the English in the late 18th century in the name—Flat Country. The Chippewa/Ottawa word "tessi-" is used to make the words for shelf, platform, bench, and plate. The phrase "tessi-aki" may have been used by Algonquin speaking people to mean the entire Thumb of Michigan and meant level land. During the Saginaw Treaty of 1819, the Native chief of Tuscola was Chief Otusson. His name was said to mean "bench in the lodge or platform". The Thumb of Michigan forms a tableland with knolls or hillocks located in the interior part along the Cass River. The county seat of Tuscola is Caro, which is located along one of these large knolls. Caro was called by Native People High Bank. The land around Caro particularly to the north and east is cultivated and widely farmed. Caro is located in Indianfields Township, which was given its name for its plentiful Indian gardens.
Ottusson was also the name of the village of the Ojibwe near the start of the Cass River. It along with a large amount of surrounding land was reserved to the Ojibwe in the 1819 Treaty of Detroit but was sold off in the 1837 treaty.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 914 square miles (2,370 km2), of which 803 square miles (2,080 km2) is land and 111 square miles (290 km2) (12%) is water.

The county government operates the jail, maintains rural roads, operates the major local courts, keeps files of deeds and mortgages, maintains vital records, administers public health regulations, and participates with the state in the provision of welfare and other social services. The county board of commissioners controls the budget but has only limited authority to make laws or ordinances. In Michigan, most local government functions — police and fire, building and zoning, tax assessment, street maintenance, etc. — are the responsibility of individual cities and townships.
