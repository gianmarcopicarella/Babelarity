Samolus (known as brookweed, or water pimpernel) is a widely distributed genus of about a dozen species of water-loving herbs. According to the APG III classification, this genus belongs to the Primulaceae family in the order Ericales. It was considered as closely related to a clade comprising the Theophrastaceae, and was treated as part of that family or in its own monogeneric family, the Samolaceae. The APG III system does not recognize these families and instead includes all species formerly belonging to Theophrastaceae in the Primulaceae family.
The last complete taxonomic treatment of this genus recognizes the following species:
Samolus cinerascens
Samolus dichondrifolius
Samolus ebracteatus
Samolus junceus
Samolus porosus
Samolus pyrolifolius
Samolus repens
Samolus spathulatus
Samolus subnudicaulis
Samolus vagans
Samolus valerandi
Samolus valerandi is native to a very wide area across Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, and the Americas; the other species have more restricted ranges.
