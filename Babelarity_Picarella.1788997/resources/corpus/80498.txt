Xiaolu Guo (simplified Chinese: 郭小橹; traditional Chinese: 郭小櫓; pinyin: Guō Xiǎolǔ) born 1973) is a Chinese-British novelist and filmmaker, who uses cinema and literary language to explore themes of alienation, memory, personal journeys, daily tragedies, literature translation and develops her own vision of China's past and its future in a global environment. Her novels have been translated into more than 26 languages. In 2013 she was named as one of Granta's Best of Young British Novelists, a list drawn up once a decade.
Guo has served on the judging panel for the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize and in 2016 she served as a jury for the Financial Times Emerging Voices Awards for Fiction. She has lectured on Creative Writing and Filmmaking at King’s College London, the University of Westminster, Colgate University, Swarthmore College in the USA as well as at Harvard University. She is an honorary Associate Professor at the University of Nottingham, UK. Guo currently lives in London and was a guest of the DAAD Artists in Residence in Berlin in 2012 and a Writer in Residence of the Literaturhaus Zurich and the PWG Foundation in Zurich in 2015.
Guo's 2005 autobiographical novel, Village of Stone focuses on two people, Coral and Red, who live together in Beijing, and how Coral's life changes one day when she receives a dried eel in the post, an anonymous gift from someone in her remote home village.
Guo's 2008 novel, A Concise Chinese-English Dictionary For Lovers, tells the story of a Chinese woman who is sent by her parents to study English in London. She soon renames herself "Z" and her encounters with an unnamed Englishman spur both of them to explore their own sense of identity. The novel is written in the heroine's broken English to begin with, in an experimental dictionary form. With each chapter her English gradually improves, reflecting the improvement of the heroine's own English over the year in which the novel is set.
Guo's 2009 novel, 20 Fragments of A Ravenous Youth is a coming of age story about a 21-year-old Chinese woman Fenfang, her life as a film extra in Beijing, to which she has traveled far to seek her fortune, only to encounter a Communist regime that has outworn its welcome, a city in varying degrees of development, and sexism more in keeping with her peasant upbringing than the country's supposedly progressive capital.
Guo's 2010 book, Lovers in the Age of Indifference is a collection of short stories, that depicts the lives of people adrift between West and East, set in various locations.
In Guo's 2015 novel, I Am China, London-based literary translator Iona Kirkpatrick discovers a story of romance and revolution as she translates a collection of letters and diaries by a Chinese punk musician named Kublai Jian. Unbeknownst to Iona, Jian has come to Britain seeking political asylum, while another character, Mu, is in Beijing trying to track him down. As the translator tracks Jian and Mu's twenty-year relationship, she develops a sense of purpose in deciding to bring Jian and Mu together again before it is too late.
Guo's 2004 film is The Concrete Revolution, a film essay about the construction workers in Beijing building stadiums for the 2008 Olympics. It received Grand Prix at the International Human Rights Film Festival in Paris, 2005.
Guo's 2006 film, How Is Your Fish Today?, is a docu-drama set in modern China, focusing on the intertwined stories of two main characters; a frustrated writer (Rao Hui) and the subject of his latest film script, Lin Hao (Zijiang Yang). It was selected for the Official Competition at Sundance Film Festival 2007 and Rotterdam Film Festival, received Grand Prix at International Women's Film Festival in France.
Guo's 2008 film, We Went to Wonderland is a black and white essay film focusing on two elderly Chinese communists who arrive in the rundown East End of London and comment the Western world from their astonished Chinese perspective. The film which premiered at the Rotterdam IFFR was immediately picked for the New Directors/New Films Festival of the MoMa / Lincoln Film Society in New York.
Guo's 2009 feature is She, A Chinese, a homage to Jean-Luc Godard's La Chinoise. This film won the Golden Leopard at the 2009 Locarno International Film Festival and the Best Script Award at the Hamburg Film Festival 2010. It has been distributed in the UK, France, Spain, Germany and Switzerland.
Guo's other 2009 film, Once upon a time Proletarian, is a sister film to She, a Chinese. This documentary looks at China in the post-Marxist era. It premieres at the Venice Film Festival 2009 and has been shown at Rotterdam IFFR and Sheffield Doc/Fest.
Guo's 2011 film, UFO In Her Eyes is a cinematic adaptation of her novel of the same title. The film stars Shi Ke and Udo Kier and is a political metaphor recounted through the transformation that befalls a small Chinese village after an alleged UFO sighting. Inspired by Soviet cinema, Xiaolu Guo dedicated this film to Soy Cuba, a 1964 Soviet-Cuban film directed by Mikhail Kalatozov. It received the Public Award at Milan 3-Continental Film Festival 2013.
Guo's 2013 film, Late at Night, Voices of Ordinary Madness, focuses on Britain's dwellers, each fighting their ground in their own way. It is the second part of Guo's Tomorrow trilogy, continued after her documentary Once Upon A Time Proletarian. It premiered at the 57th BFI London Film Festival 2013 and Rotterdam Film Festival 2014, and was exhibited at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC.
Guo's third novel, A Concise Chinese-English Dictionary For Lovers, inspired by Roland Barthes's "A Lover's Discourse", written originally in English, was nominated for the 2007 Orange Prize for Fiction and it has been translated into 26 languages. She was also the 2005 Pearl Award (UK) winner for Creative Excellence. Her first novel Village of Stone was nominated for the Independent best Foreign Fiction Prize as well as the International Dublin IMPAC Awards. She writes in both English and Chinese, and has served as the jury member for the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize. Her most recent novel is I Am China, set in Europe, China and America, was awarded for Giuseppe Acerbi Prize for Young Readers 2015 in Italy and longlisted for the 2015 Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction.

Her previous feature How Is Your Fish Today was in Official Selection at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival and received the Grand Jury Prize at the 2007 Créteil International Women's Film Festival in Paris.
