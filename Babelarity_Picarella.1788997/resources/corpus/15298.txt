Berdyev always carries his pray beads with him. He never appears without them. " I don’t consider it a token or a tradition. It’s just something I need. I just feel that I have to keep them in my hands when I’m watching a game. I don’t feel well without them. There were a couple of times when I accidentally forgot to take them to matches, even though it wasn’t my fault. And I was feeling uncomfortable through the game, as if I was missing something. Thus this is just a need I feel. I think Muslims will understand me."
Education – Ashgabat Railroads Vocational School (1967–71), Turkmen State University (1971–1975), Moscow Higher Coaching School (1989–1991).
