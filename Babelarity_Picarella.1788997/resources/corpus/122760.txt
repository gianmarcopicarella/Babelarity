Dje (Ђ ђ; italics: Ђ ђ) is a letter of the Cyrillic script.
Dje is the sixth letter of the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet, used in Serbo-Croatian to represent the voiced alveolo-palatal affricate /dʑ/, like the 〈j〉 in "juice".
Dje corresponds to the Latin letter D with stroke (Đ đ) in Gaj's Latin alphabet of Serbo-Croatian and is so transliterated. When strokes are unavailable, it is transliterated as〈Dj dj〉.
Dje was constructed by request of Vuk Stefanović Karadžić. There were several proposed shapes of the letter (one by Pavle Solarić, another by Gligorije Geršić). The variant now in use was designed by Lukijan Mušicki; it was designed by modification of the letter Ћ, itself a revival of the old Cyrillic letter Djerv (Ꙉ). The new letter was adopted in Karadžić's 1818 dictionary and thus entered widespread usage.
