Mariano Gonzalo Andújar (born 30 July 1983) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Argentine Primera División club Estudiantes.
In 2009, Andújar was the first team goalkeeper in Estudiantes' Copa Libertadores winning team. Andújar did not concede a single goal in any of the eight games in La Plata and he set a new tournament record of 800 minutes without conceding a goal, beating Hugo Gatti's 767 minutes.
On 24 June 2009, Italian club Catania officially announced that the club had signed the player to a four-year deal.
On 24 January 2014, Napoli's official website posted that Andújar was in Naples completing a medical in preparation for his move to the Italian club. Four days later a co-ownership deal was reached with Andújar being loaned back to Catania for the remainder of the season. He will join Napoli at the start of the 2014–15 campaign. He made his debut in Naples on 11 December 2014, in a match against Slovan Bratislava (winning 3-0), in the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League, in the last match of the group stage.
During the midway point of the 2014–15 season, Andújar secured his place in Napoli's starting lineup, thanks to good performances and the decline of Napoli first-choice keeper Rafael. On 24 April 2015, Andújar led Napoli to the Europa League semi-finals with a solid performance against Wolfsburg. Napoli advanced from the tie with a 6-3 aggregate.
Andújar made his debut for the Argentina national football team in a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Colombia on 6 June 2009.
During the 2010 FIFA World Cup and 2011 Copa América, Andújar served as understudy to Sergio Romero, the first choice goalkeeper for the Albiceleste.
In June 2014, Andújar was named in Argentina's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
