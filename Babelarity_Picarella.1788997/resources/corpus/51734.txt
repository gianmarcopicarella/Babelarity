Softpedia is a website that indexes information and provides primarily software information and downloads. Its main sections are Windows, Mac, Linux, Games, Drivers, Mobile, Webscripts, and News. It also covers technology and science topics from both external and in-house sources, and it provides software and game reviews.
Wherever possible, it includes one or more screenshots of each application, often showing the application's menus to help illustrate its features.
Softpedia does not repack software for distribution. It provides direct downloads of software in its original distribution form, links to developers' downloads, or both.
Like Download.com, Softpedia is a "popular destination for software downloads". It is owned by SoftNews NET SRL., a Romanian company.
