Aide Brown Ideye (born 10 October 1988) is a Nigerian professional footballer who plays as a central striker for Greek club Olympiacos and the Nigeria national team.
Ideye began his career with Bayelsa United before moving to Ocean Boys. He was a member of the Ocean Boys team that won the Nigerian Premier League.
Ideye moved in January 2008 to Europe to sign with Swiss Super League club Neuchâtel Xamax. Before this move to Switzerland, he was on trial with Dutch side Willem II, but was not signed. After three years with Xamax, Ideye left to sign for French Ligue 1 club Sochaux.
On 6 July 2011, Ideye signed a five-year deal with Ukrainian side Dynamo Kyiv. He made his first appearance on 16 July against Oleksandria, scoring two goals. In his second game for Dynamo, he again scored a brace, this time against Obolon Kyiv. On 7 August 2012, Ideye scored the winner in a UEFA Champions League qualifying third round second-leg game against Feyenoord, in which Dynamo ultimately progressed. He also scored against Borussia Mönchengladbach in the second-leg of the play-off round. Mönchengladbach won the game 2–1, but Kyiv progressed to the Champions League group stage on a 4–3 aggregate score. On 15 May 2014, Ideye was an unused substitute in Dynamo's 2–1 win over Shakhtar Donetsk in the 2014 Ukrainian Cup Final.
On 18 July 2014, Ideye signed a three-year deal with English Premier League club West Bromwich Albion, becoming the club's record signing at a fee reported as £10 million. The contract included an option in the club's favour for an extra year. He was assigned the number 9 shirt. After a difficult start to the season in England, Ideye scored his first league goal for the club in their 3–1 loss to Manchester City on Boxing Day 2014, and scored four times in a six-day spell in February 2015 with goals against Burnley and Swansea City in the Premier League and two against West Ham United in the FA Cup.
On 31 August 2015, Ideye joined Olympiacos from West Brom for an undisclosed fee, though believed to be around €6 million. The prospect of featuring in the Champions League again was rumoured to play a crucial role in convincing Ideye to move to the Athens-based club.
On 20 October 2015, Ideye scored a goal in Olympiacos' Champions League group stage victory over Dinamo Zagreb (1–0). He scored the 79th-minute winner with a superb finish from a tight angle, redeeming himself for an astonishing miss earlier in the second half. On 9 March 2016, Ideye received a lucrative offer from China during the January transfer window, however he rejected the offer as he preferred to stay with the reigning Superleague Greece champions. On 17 April 2016, he was a key member for the club as it celebrated winning the domestic championship for the sixth consecutive season.
Ideye represented his country at the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Canada. He played five games in the tournament and scored one goal, against Costa Rica. In May 2010, he was called up to the senior side as part of the 30-man team for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. He was not part of the final 23-man squad, but he was subsequently called up after a knee injury to John Obi Mikel ruled him out of the competition. Ideye was also called up to Nigeria's 23-man squad for the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, playing in most of their games at the tournament. He scored Nigeria's second goal in their 4–1 semi-final win over Mali and played in their 1–0 win over Burkina Faso in the final.
Ideye was selected for Nigeria's squad at the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup.
