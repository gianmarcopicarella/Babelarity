Star Trek: Legacy, had mixed to moderate reviews for the Xbox 360 and was negatively received for the PC.
The company's Empire Earth III has been the subject of many harsh reviews, with GameSpot saying, "Empire Earth III has been dumbed down to the point of irrelevance." Mad Doc has since removed Empire Earth III from their list of games on their website and any trace of it.
Mad Doc has also created an autonomous cross-country navigation system for the U.S. Dept. of Defense.
Mad Doc was contracted to partner with Propaganda Games and Threewave Software for various map designs for the 2008 game Turok.

On April 4, 2008, Rockstar Games announced that it had acquired the studio and rebranded it Rockstar New England. Since its acquisition, New England has mainly been offering assistance to all Rockstar studios and their respective titles. The studio has yet to work on a title of its own since then.
