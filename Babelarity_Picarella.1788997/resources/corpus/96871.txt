Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a 2004 action-adventure platformer video game that was released concurrently with the film release of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. The game was based on the film of the same name and on J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, the third novel in the Harry Potter series.
The game received "mixed" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.
The Times gave the game a score of four stars out of five and stated, "The game remains faithful to the spirit of the book, but it is perhaps a little too linear and predictable. Some scenes do not look quite right — the scale of the characters against the width of the Hogwarts Express clearly do not tally. But these minor disappointments are quickly outweighed by stunning visuals in the later levels. While older teenagers may snub this Harry Potter outing, there’s still good mileage in the bespectacled chappie for younger players."
