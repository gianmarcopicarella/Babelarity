Ana Ivanovic was the defending champion, but lost in the fourth round to Victoria Azarenka.
Svetlana Kuznetsova, the seventh seed and runner-up to Justine Henin in the 2006 final, won in the final 6–4, 6–2, against Dinara Safina in 74 minutes. It was the third all-Russian final in Grand Slam history, and the first since 2004. Kuznetsova won her first Grand Slam since the 2004 US Open, where she also won in an all-Russian final over Elena Dementieva, and second overall. Safina fell to 0–3 in Grand Slam finals with the loss. The match was also the conclusion of a series of matches between them during the preceding clay court season, with Kuznetsova beating Safina to win the title in Stuttgart, and Safina avenging the loss by beating Kuznetsova in Rome.
