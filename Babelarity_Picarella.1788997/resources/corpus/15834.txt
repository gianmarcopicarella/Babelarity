The 1973 South African Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Kyalami on 3 March 1973. It was the third race of the 1973 World Championship of Drivers and the 1973 International Cup for F1 Manufacturers. The race was won by Jackie Stewart driving a Tyrrell. Denny Hulme's pole position was the only one of his Formula One World Championship career.
Mike Hailwood was recognised for bravery when he went to pull Clay Regazzoni from his burning car after the two collided on the second lap of the race. Hailwood's driving suit caught fire, but after being extinguished by a fire marshall he returned to help rescue Regazzoni, an act for which he was awarded the George Medal.
Note: Only the top five positions are included for both sets of standings.
