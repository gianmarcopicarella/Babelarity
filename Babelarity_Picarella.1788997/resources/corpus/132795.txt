Kemetism (also Kemeticism; both from the Egyptian kmt or Kemet, the native name of Ancient Egypt), also sometimes referred to as Neterism (from ntr (Coptic noute) "deity"), or Egyptian Neopaganism, is the contemporary revival of Ancient Egyptian religion and related expressions of religion in classical and late antiquity, emerging during the 1970s. A Kemetic is one who follows Kemetism.
There are several main groups, each of which take a different approach to their beliefs, ranging from eclectic to reconstructionistic. They include, but are not limited to: reconstructed Egyptian polytheism (adopting an academic and philological approach), Kemetic Orthodoxy (which adopts some elements of reconstructionism, but has a non-traditional henotheistic theology) and Neo-Atenism.
