Prince Karl Theodor of Bavaria (German: Karl Theodor Maximilian August von Bayern; Munich, 7 July 1795 – Tegernsee, 16 August 1875) was a member of the Wittelsbach dynasty. He was the second son and fifth child of Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria (1756–1825) and Augusta Wilhelmine of Hesse-Darmstadt (1765–96).
Prince Karl served in the Bavarian Army. During the War of the Sixth Coalition of 1813–1814, he commanded a brigade under Karl Philipp von Wrede. In 1831 Karl rejected the offer of the crown of Greece, which then devolved upon his nephew, Prince Otto. On 16 January 1841 Karl was appointed field marshal and inspector of the Bavarian Army. In 1860 he became commander in chief of the 7th German Federal Army Corps. At the age of 71, he commanded Bavarian forces in the Austro-Prussian War with General Ludwig von der Tann. However, they were both considered unsuccessful commanders because the troops they led were often lost or killed by the Prussians. In one incident, the German Confederation Union Army 7th Corps received orders to join the retreating Hanoverian army at Hersfeld, but Prince Karl did not know the location of his allies and waited until it was too late.
Prince Karl resided in the Prinz-Carl-Palais in Munich. He married twice, both times morganatically. On 1 October 1823 he married his first wife, Marie Anna Sophie de Pétin (Neuberg-an-der-Donau, 27 July 1796 – Tegernsee, 22 February 1838), who was given the title Baroness von Bayrstorff. They had three daughters, each of whom was given the title Countess von Bayerstorff in 1840:
Caroline Sophie, Countess von Bayrstorff (17 October 1816 – 25 May 1889); married on 1 March 1834 Adolf Eberhard, Baron von Gumppenberg (Munich, 24 February 1804 – Munich, 16 December 1877); they had issue.
Maximiliane Theodore, Countess von Bayrstorff (30 September 1823 – 19 March 1885); married on 7 July 1841 August, Count von Drechsel zu Deuffstetten (Munich, 28 March 1810 – Munich, 20 May 1880); they had issue.
Franziska Sophie, Countess von Bayrstorff (10 October 1827 – 2 March 1912); married on 7 July 1845 Paulo Martins, Visconde de Almeida (Rio de Janeiro, 18 June 1806 – Munich, 5 April 1874); they had issue.
His second marriage was to Henriette Schöller (Munich, 27 December 1815 – Tegernsee, 20 April 1866) and took place on May 7, 1859. There were no children from this marriage.
