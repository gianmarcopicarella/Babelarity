Chalfont & Latimer station is a London Underground and National Rail station in Travelcard Zone 8 (previously zone C) on the Metropolitan line, in Buckinghamshire. It is the junction between the service to Amersham and Chesham. It is also on Chiltern Railways' line to Aylesbury.
The station serves all three of the Chalfonts; Chalfont St Giles, Chalfont St Peter and Little Chalfont â€” as well as the village of Latimer. It is located in Little Chalfont. It opened as "Chalfont Road" with the new line on 8 July 1889 but changed to the present name from 1 November 1915. The station is a good place to alight for walks in the Chilterns and the Chess Valley.
Chalfont & Latimer station was formerly served by steam hauled Metropolitan line trains from Aylesbury to London, with a changeover to an electric locomotive at Rickmansworth. The electrification north of Rickmansworth (to Amersham as well as the Chesham branch) was completed in 1960, with steam trains being finally withdrawn in 1961. British Railways took over the operation of the service north of Amersham at the same time, using Class 115 diesel multiple unit trains. Main line trains from London Marylebone to Sheffield via the former Great Central Railway line passed through the station without stopping; this service was withdrawn in 1966. The station had a goods yard, which closed on 14 November 1966.
From the early 1960s, Metropolitan line trains at Chalfont & Latimer were formed of A60 and A62 Stock. Up till 11 December 2010 the Chesham branch was served by a single four car unit (using Chalfont & Latimer station's bay platform), except for two through trains in either direction during peak-periods. From 12 December 2010, the Chesham service was formed of eight cars with new S Stock trains being introduced. Chiltern Railways (Aylesbury-Marylebone) trains are formed by Class 165 and Class 168 diesel multiple units.
