Rexburg is a city in Madison County, Idaho, United States. The population was 25,484 at the 2010 census, up from 17,257 in 2000. The city is the county seat of Madison County and its largest city. Rexburg is the principal city of the Rexburg, ID Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes Fremont and Madison Counties. The city is home to Brigham Young University-Idaho (BYU-Idaho), a private institution operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).
The city takes its name from Ricks, the German form of which is "Rex", after founder Thomas Edwin Ricks. The city was incorporated in 1883.
Rexburg was severely damaged by the famous Teton Dam Flood in June 1976. The Teton River flowed through northern Rexburg, and left most of the city underwater for several days after the Teton Dam ruptured. Cooperation of the people within the community quickened the recovery. A museum dedicated to the Teton Dam Flood and the history of Rexburg and the area, located in the basement of the Rexburg Tabernacle, has been a major city landmark for decades.
When the Rexburg Idaho Temple was dedicated in 2008, Rexburg became the third city in Idaho with an LDS temple.
Rexburg is located at 43°49′N 111°47′W, at an elevation of 4,865 feet (1,483 m) above sea level.

Much of the city, including BYU-Idaho and the Rexburg Idaho Temple, rests on top of a shield volcano just north of Rigby, ID. Eruptions are not expected in the near future so far south; Yellowstone National Park and Island Park are the most likely settings for future volcanic activity in the area. Many different types of volcanoes exist near Rexburg, including cinder cones, spatter cones, other shield volcanoes, and volcanic fissures. There are lava fields to the west and south of Rexburg, the results of open fissure eruptions from about two thousand years ago. The nearby Craters of the Moon National Monument presents the most obvious features of this recent activity. Sediment deposits enriched by volcanism make the surrounding area famous for its production of large starch-rich potatoes.
Rexburg is close to the St. Anthony Sand Dunes, the West Entrance of Yellowstone National Park and the Teton Range.

Rexburg has been referred to as the "reddest place in America," owing to the area's strong conservative majority and political trends. Some political experts have considered Rexburg, Idaho the true antithesis of San Francisco, America's liberal bastion. Since 1980 no Republican presidential candidate has won less than 59 percent of the county vote. In that same period Republican presidential candidates polled more than 90 percent of the county's vote on three occasions: Ronald Reagan in 1984, George W. Bush in 2004 and Mitt Romney in 2012. John McCain came close to this level in 2008, drawing 85 percent of the vote.
The public high school is Madison High School, which has the bobcat as its mascot.
Rexburg is home to BYU-Idaho, a private institution operated by LDS Church. The university began as a small high school-level academy in 1888 and was eventually established as Ricks College, in honor of Mormon pioneer and city founder, Thomas E. Ricks. On August 10, 2001, it officially became a four-year university and assumed the name BYU-Idaho.
The City of Rexburg and the surrounding areas are serviced by Madison Memorial Hospital located just east of the city's downtown area. The hospital offers regular classes in an attempt to educate the community on such things as preparing for childbirth and first aid for children, as well as holding Conferences and Health Fairs. In 2012 the Leapfrog Group announced the results of a study which indicated that Madison Memorial Hospital is the seventh worst performing hospital in the United States. Madison Memorial declined to participate in the Leapfrog survey, which the hospital says made the survey biased against it. Also in 2012, Rachel Gonzales - Madison's CEO, was ranked amongst the "50 Rural Hospital CEO's to Know" by Becker's Hospital Review. In 2013, Madison was ranked the healthiest county in Idaho. In 2014, the Leapfrog Group shared the results of a study which indicates that Madison Memorial Hospital received an A in comparison to other hospitals in the United States.
