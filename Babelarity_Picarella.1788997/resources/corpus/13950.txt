The Azerbaijan First Division (Azerbaijani: Az…ôrbaycan Birinci Divizionu) is the second highest professional division in Azerbaijani professional football. The division is run by AFFA.
Due to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, all Azerbaijan clubs of the former Soviet Premier Division and Soviet First Division conformed a single Azerbaijan Premier League, which meant that the new second tier of Azerbaijan football would remain regionalized. For the first two seasons three regional groups conformed the second tier, until in 1994 the single table in use today began to be used.
The First Division currently consists of 14 teams. All teams play each other two times.
CBC currently own all the rights to broadcast the season's games on terrestrial TV. In Azerbaijan, the First Division games is also available on CBC Sport.
