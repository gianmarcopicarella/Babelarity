Lake County is a county located in the U.S. state of Tennessee. As of the 2010 census, the population was 7,832, making it the fifth-least populous county in Tennessee. Its county seat is Tiptonville. It is the state's northwesternmost county, sharing a border with Kentucky and separated from Missouri to the west by the Mississippi River. Reelfoot Lake occupies much of the northern part of the county.
The history of Lake County has been largely defined by Reelfoot Lake, a natural lake created by the New Madrid earthquakes of 1811 and 1812. The county was established by the state legislature in 1870. It was originally included in Obion County, but was created as a separate county due to difficulties its residents had to cross the swampy wetlands around Reelfoot Lake to reach Obion's county seat. Tiptonville was designated as Lake County's seat of government.
In 1862, during the Civil War, the Battle of Island Number Ten took place in the Mississippi River, just off the shores of what is now Lake County.
In 1907, a violent conflict took place in Lake and Obion counties when a private company, the West Tennessee Land Company, gained control of Reelfoot Lake and announced plans to drain it. A band of local renegades, known as the "Night Riders of Reelfoot Lake," harassed the company's employees, eventually kidnapping and killing one. Governor Malcolm Patterson personally led the Tennessee National Guard into the area, and arrested hundreds of suspected Night Riders. The state gained title to the lake in 1914, and the lake was designated as a hunting and fishing reserve by Governor Austin Peay in 1925. This was the precedent for the area to be preserved as the modern Reelfoot Lake State Park.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 194 square miles (500 km2), of which 166 square miles (430 km2) is land and 28 square miles (73 km2) (14%) is water. It is the fifth-smallest county in Tennessee by area.
