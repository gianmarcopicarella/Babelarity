The Supercopa de España or the Spanish Super Cup is a Spanish football championship contested by the winners of La Liga and the Copa del Rey. In the event that a team wins both La Liga and the Copa del Rey, the runners up of the Copa del Rey will play against the winner of La Liga.
The current competition has only existed since 1982, but between 1940 and 1953, several other tournaments between the Spanish league champions and the cup winners (then Copa del Generalísimo) were played.
In 1940, it had the name of Copa de Campeones. It was not played again until 1945, when the Ambassador of Argentina, due to the good relations with the Spanish military government, offered a trophy called the Copa de Oro Argentina. Both these tournaments were unofficial.
In 1941 the "Copa Presidente FEF" was established as an official tournament founded and organized by the RFEF.
In 1947, the Copa Eva Duarte de Perón was established as an annual and official tournament founded and organized by the RFEF, as a tribute to Juan Perón, the President of Argentina, and his wife Eva Perón. They were played between September and December, usually as one-match finals.
Lionel Messi has the most goals scored by a player in the Spanish Super Cups with 11 goals.
* In 1952  and 1953 the cup was awarded to FC Barcelona, as they had won the La Liga / Copa del Generalísimo double.
Except for the 1983, 1988 and 1992 tournaments, the first leg match was played always at the Cup winner's stadium.
