In the catalogue of stars in the Calendarium of Al Achsasi al Mouakket, this star was designated Rabah al Naamat (رابع ألنعامة - raabi3 al naʽāmāt), which was translated into Latin as Quarta Struthionum, meaning the fourth ostrich. This star, along with η Cet (Deneb Algenubi), θ Cet (Thanih Al Naamat), τ Cet (Thalath Al Naamat), and υ Cet, were Al Naʽāmāt (ألنعامة), the Hen Ostriches.
In Chinese, 天倉 (Tiān Cāng), meaning Square Celestial Granary, refers to an asterism consisting of ζ Ceti, ι Ceti, θ Ceti, η Ceti, τ Ceti and 57 Ceti. Consequently, ζ Ceti itself is known as 天倉四 (Tiān Cāng sì, English: the Second Star of Square Celestial Granary.)
