In Greek mythology, Idmon was an Argonaut seer. Allegedly a son of Apollo, he had Abas (or Ampycus) as his mortal father. His mother was Asteria, daughter of Coronus, or Cyrene, or else Antianeira, daughter of Pheres. By Laothoe he had a son Thestor. Idmon foresaw his own death in the Argonaut expedition, but joined anyway. During the outbound voyage of Argo, a boar killed him in the land of the Mariandyni, in Bithynia.
In 559 BC the citizens of Megara Heraclea (today's Eregli) built a temple over Idmon's grave.
The name Idmon may also refer to:
One of the fifty sons of Aegyptus, who married and was killed by the Danaid Pylarge.
The father of Arachne.
The herald of Turnus.
A figure briefly mentioned in Statius' Thebaid. He came from Epidaurus and was portrayed in the poem cleansing his wounds after a battle.
