On his first show after the attacks of September 11, 2001, Letterman gave an impassioned monologue about New York City in the aftermath. He concluded the now-famous 7-minute speech by mentioning Choteau's rally to raise money for victims of the attacks, despite the long drought there.
On March 19, 2009, Letterman married his girlfriend of 23 years at the Teton County Courthouse in Choteau.
