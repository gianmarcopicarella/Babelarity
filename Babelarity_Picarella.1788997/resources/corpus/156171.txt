Okaya (岡谷市, Okaya-shi) is a city on Lake Suwa in Nagano Prefecture, Japan. The Tenryū River begins its course in Okaya, flowing from its headwaters in Lake Suwa.
From the Meiji period through the start of the Shōwa period (1868-1930), the Okaya area was one of Japan's largest producers of export-quality silk, due to the introduction of a new silk-reeling machine from overseas. The city was founded on April 1, 1936.
After the World War II, Okaya established itself as a manufacturing city of precision machinery, focusing on producing products such as watches and cameras.
As of May 1, 2011, the city of Okaya had an estimated population of 52,556, with 19,536 households and a population density of 616.93 persons per km². The total area is 85.19 km².
The region's local industry is predominantly made up of medium- and small-size businesses, but some big-name businesses such as Seiko Epson, Olympus and Kyocera.
The city is twinned with Mount Pleasant, Michigan, United States. In 2005 it donated forty trees to Mount Pleasant, honoring forty years of association between the two cities.
The city is known for its Onbashira and Taiko festivals, and unagi (eel) dishes. It claims itself the birthplace of modern-day skating, perhaps in Japan.
To remember the importance for the Japanese silk industry, the Okaya Silk Museum opened its doors in 1964. Besides pictures of the old manufacturing techniques and people working in the silk reeling manufactures, there is old machinery and a full-functioning manufacture that is run by the Miyasaka Silk Reeling Co. in the museum.
