The line was built with a track gauge of 1,372 mm (4 ft 6 in) to allow through operations onto the Keiō network. The line was planned as Line 10 according to reports of a committee of the former Ministry of Transportation; thus the rarely used official name of the line is the "Number 10 Shinjuku Line" (10号線新宿線, Jū-gō-sen Shinjuku-sen).
According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation, as of June 2009 the Shinjuku Line was the third most crowded subway line in Tokyo, at its peak running at 181% capacity between Nishi-ōjima and Sumiyoshi stations.
Express trains stop at stations marked with a circle (●), while local trains make all stops.
Express trains run between Motoyawata Station and Hashimoto Station on the Keiō Sagamihara Line via the Keio Main Line and Keio New Line.
On weekends and holidays, two trains run through to Takaosan-guchi Station on the Keiō Takao Line and one runs through to Tama-Dōbutsukōen Station on the Keiō Dōbutsuen Line.
