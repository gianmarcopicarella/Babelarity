Darling is a women's fragrance from Coty, Inc., and the first perfume to be endorsed by Kylie Minogue, released on 9 November 2006. The perfume was designed by Thierry Wasser from Firmenich. Wasser wanted to create a perfume which reflects the Australian singer: the key notes are Australian sandalwood, star fruit, freesia and Boronia flower.
In 2007 the successor of the perfume, Sweet Darling came into the markets. Having the base as its predecessor, cotton candy, patchouli and vanilla were added into the original substance. Sweet Darling was a limited edition, being available only in 2007. In 2008 the third version of Darling, Sexy Darling, was released. It was created by Sophie Labbe and it contains blood orange, pear, pink pepper, red rose, belle de nuit, jasmine, sandalwood and musk. In 2011 a new incarnation of Darling was released as Dazzling Darling.
