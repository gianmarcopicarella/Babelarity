Huntertown is a town in Allen County, Indiana, United States. The population was 4,810 at the 2010 census, making it one of the fastest-growing areas in northeastern Indiana, with a population increase of 172 percent since 2000.
Huntertown was originally called "The Opening" because it was a natural forest clearing. Huntertown was first settled circa 1837, founded by William T. Hunter. The village was located along the Lima Plank Road connecting Lima (now Howe) and Fort Wayne. The Perry Centre Seminary was founded in Huntertown in 1856, only to close five years later when the entire faculty and adult students enlisted in the Union Army. The town was platted in 1869, but not incorporated until 1966.
Some of the nation's oldest reliable weather observations are from a nineteenth-century Huntertown farm. Rapin Andrews began keeping meteorological records on July 17, 1839, and continued until his death ten years later. His family continued the observations until April 30, 1874. The diary of weather records was presented to the U.S. Weather Bureau (now the National Weather Service) in 1934. The record highest temperature was 102 °F (39 °C) in July 1846 and the record lowest temperature was −34 °F (−37 °C) on January 29, 1873.
Since much of Huntertown's growth has come from people moving from urbanized areas like Fort Wayne to new suburban subdivisions, the expectations for services have increased. For example, the town council expanded from three to five members to lessen the workload. The council now is working on creating a new water plant, a parks board, and a new 27-acre (110,000 m2) park. Huntertown is the adopted home of noted artist and historian James B. O'Connor.
The town's weekly newspaper, Northwest News, began operations in the summer of 1997 in the former Huntertown State Bank, site of a 1930s robbery by the John Dillinger gang.
