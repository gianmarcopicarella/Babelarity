Shogakukan Inc. (株式会社小学館, Kabushiki gaisha Shōgakukan) is a Japanese publisher of dictionaries, literature, manga, non-fiction, DVDs, and other media in Japan.
Shogakukan founded Shueisha, which also founded Hakusensha. These are three separate companies, but are together called the Hitotsubashi Group, one of the largest publishing groups in Japan. Shogakukan is headquartered in the Shogakukan Building in Hitotsubashi, Chiyoda, Tokyo, and the other two companies are located in the same ward.
Shogakukan, along with Shueisha, owns Viz Media, which publishes manga from both companies in the United States.
Shogakukan's licensing arm in North America was ShoPro Entertainment; it was merged into Viz Media in 2005.
Shogakukan's production arm is Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions Co., Ltd. (previously Shogakukan Productions Co.,Ltd.)
In March 2010 it was announced that Shogakukan would partner with the American comics publisher Fantagraphics to issue a line of manga to be edited by Matt Thorn.
In Europe, manga from Shōgakukan and Shūeisha are published by local publishers such like Pika Édition, Ki-oon, Kana or Kazé for the French market, and Kazé, Carlsen, Egmont or Tokyopop for the German market. Shogakukan, Shueisha and ShoPro have made a joint venture named Viz Media Europe. Viz Media Europe bought in 2009 the French Kazé Group whose activities are mainly publishing manga and home video for the French and German market.
The company has a wholly owned subsidiary, Shogakukan Asia, headquartered in Singapore. The company previously partnered with local companies.
