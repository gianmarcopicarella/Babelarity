Duga Resa is a town in Karlovac County, Croatia. It is located about 65 km southwest of Zagreb and 100 km east of Rijeka.
The earliest reference to Duga Resa is from the year 1380. There are several theories on how the then-village acquired its name: one is that "resa" is a reference to the town people's folk costumes; another is that it is named from a native plant that grows in the area, both on the land and in the water.
The village soon grew into a town during the industrialization of the area in the late 19th and early 20th century. In the 2001 census, there were 12,114 inhabitants in the municipality, 96% of which were Croats.
In 2011, the total population is 11,180, in the following settlements:
Popular activities include fishing, rafting, hunting, boating, swimming, volleyball, soccer, and biking. The local churches St. Antun in Duga Resa and St. Peters (Sveti Petar) dates back to the 14th century.
Its geographic location gives the town very hot summers and very cold winters.
