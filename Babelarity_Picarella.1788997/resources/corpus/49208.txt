The rupee is the currency of the Seychelles. It is subdivided into 100 cents. In the local Seychellois Creole (Seselwa) language, it is called the roupi. The international currency code is SCR. The abbreviations SR and SRe are sometimes used. Several other currencies are also called rupee.
The British Legislative Council authorized the establishment of a Board of Commissioners of Currency through the Paper Currency Ordinance of 1914, which was enacted by C. R. M. O’Brien, the governor of the Colony of the Seychelles on 10 August 1914. In 1914, the government produced emergency issues of notes for 50 cents, 1, 5 and 10 rupees.
Standard issue notes began to be issued in 1918, with notes for 50 cents and 1 rupee, followed by 5, 10 and 50 rupees in 1928. The 50 cents and 1 rupee notes were issued until 1951 and phased out in favor of the coins. 20- and 100-rupee notes were first introduced in 1968, whilst the 5-rupee note was replaced by a coin in 1972.
In 1976, the Seychelles Monetary Authority took over the issuance of paper money, issuing notes for 10, 25, 50 and 100 rupees. This series featured the first president of the Seychelles, James Mancham and replaced all colonial notes issued prior to independence.
In 1979, there was a redesign, featuring a more socialist and modernized theme reminiscent of the René Regime. This series was also issued by the Central Bank of Seychelles when it took over full responsibility in the same year.
In 1989, a new series was introduced with better security features and colors.
In 1998, another more high-tech series was introduced with a more practical, ergonomic design. This series later saw an additional 500-rupee note first introduced in 2005.
On June 7, 2011, the Central Bank of Seychelles issued updated 50, 100 and 500 rupees notes with improved security features. Each of the three banknotes has a holographic patch instead of a foil sailfish which currently appears on the notes.
On the 50-rupee note, the silver holographic sailfish alternates between the number 50 and an image of the Aldabra rail, a flightless bird.
On the 100-rupee note, the gold holographic sailfish alternates between the number 100 and an image of the Seychelles giant tortoise.
On the 500-rupee note, the gold holographic sailfish alternates between the number 500 and an image of the Seychelles scops owl.
Additional security upgrades include a 2.5-mm wide fluorescent security thread on the 50-rupee note, a 2.5-mm wide color-shifting security thread on the 100-rupee note, and a 3-mm wide color-shifting security thread on the 500-rupee note. The notes are also protected by De La Rue’s unique Gemini technology that fluoresces under ultraviolet light but appears normal in daylight.
The color schemes of the notes have been revised, with the notes being more green, red, and orange, respectively, than the notes currently in circulation. The new notes also carry the year of printing, as well as the signature of Pierre Laporte, the bank’s current governor. Existing notes remain legal tender and will be removed from circulation as they wear out.
