Estadio Municipal de Riazor [esˈtaðjo muniθiˈpal de ri.aˈθoɾ] is a multi-purpose stadium in A Coruña, Galicia, Spain. The stadium is the home ground of Deportivo de La Coruña, and accommodates a total of 34,600 spectators.
Although the stadium hosted home games for Deportivo since its establishment in 1906, it wasn't until 1944 that essential facilities (e.g. Stands, Changing rooms...) were constructed. That year, the stadium was officially known as Deportivo's ground. The opening game was against Valencia CF on 28 October 1944, which saw Depor lose 2-3.
The enormous total capacity of 30,000 led Riazor to be one of the chosen stadia to host the 1982 FIFA World Cup finals. Also, this asset made Riazor favorable for a Copa del Rey final between Real Madrid and RCD Espanyol in 1947, which saw the capital's side claim their ninth cup title.
The stadium was one of the venues of the 1982 FIFA World Cup, and held the following matches:
