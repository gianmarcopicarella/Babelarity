Khachapuri (Georgian: ხაჭაპური [xɑtʃʼɑpʼuri] from ხაჭო xačʼo "curds" + პური pʼuri "bread") is a traditional Georgian dish of cheese-filled bread. The bread is leavened and allowed to rise, and is shaped in various ways. The filling contains cheese (fresh or aged, most commonly suluguni), eggs and other ingredients.
According to a 2009 survey 88% of Georgians prefer khachapuri to pizza. It is more popular among men and older people. As a Georgian staple food, the price of making a khachapuri is used as a measure of inflation in different Georgian cities by the Khachapuri index, developed by the International School of Economics at Tbilisi State University.
There are several distinctive types of khachapuri in Georgian food from different regions of Georgia:
Imeretian (Imeruli) khachapuri, which is circular and probably the most common type.
Adjarian (Acharuli/Adjaruli) khachapuri, in which the dough is formed into an open boat shape and the hot pie is topped with a raw egg and a pat of butter before serving
Mingrelian (Megruli) khachapuri, similar to Imeritian but with more cheese added on top
Achma, from Abkhazia, which has multiple layers and looks more like a sauceless lasagna.
Gurian (Guruli) khachapuri, in addition which has boiled eggs inside dough and looks like Calzone. Arguably, it is not a type of Khachapuri. Gurians make them for Christmas and call them simply 'Christmas pie'. In the rest of Georgia, it is called 'Gurian pie'.
Ossetian (Ossuri) khachapuri, which has potato as well as cheese in its filling. It is commonly called Khabizgini.
Svanuri khachapuri
Rachuli khachapuri
Phenovani khachapuri
Khachapuri is popular in the post-Soviet states, including in Russia. It was reported that 175,000 khachapuris were consumed during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Khachapuri is a popular street food in Armenia, where it is widely served at restaurants and school cafeterias. It has become increasingly popular as a brunch food in Israel.
