Fenerbahçe Men's Basketball Team (Turkish: Fenerbahçe Erkek Basketbol Takımı) is a Turkish professional basketball team from Istanbul, Turkey. It is the men's basketball department of Fenerbahçe, a major multi-sport club. The team competes in the Turkish Basketball Super League and Euroleague.
Fenerbahçe's men's basketball department was founded in 1913, and achieved considerable success when the sport established itself in Turkey. Fenerbahçe won Turkish Basketball Championship national titles in 1957, 1959, and 1965, just before the Turkish Basketball Super League was founded in 1966, and made it to the Euroleague in 1960 and 1966. Its fans had to wait until 1991 for another title, when Levent Topsakal, Larry Richard, and head coach Çetin Yılmaz led Fenerbahçe to the Turkish League title over Tofaş.
Fenerbahçe returned to the Euroleague in 1992, but lost in the preliminary round. Fenerbahçe was back in the Turkish League finals in 1992, 1993 and, 1995, but could not find a way to win the championship for some time. A third-place finish in the 1997–98 season allowed the club to return to the Euroleague, and with players like Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, Marko Milič, Žan Tabak, İbrahim Kutluay, and the late Conrad McRae, Fenerbahçe advanced to the eighth-final playoffs, losing there to Real Madrid. The club made it to the Korać Cup quarter-finals in 1995–96 and 2000–01, and also finished in fourth place in the 2004–05 FIBA Europe League.
In the summer of 2006, the basketball club merged with Ülkerspor, to form Fenerbahçe Ülker. After the merger, Fenerbahce dominated the Turkish League and became the league champions two times in a row. After losing the third Turkish League finals after the merger, to Efes Pilsen, in a closely contested playoff finals, Fenerbahçe became Turkish League champions again in the 2009–10 season, this time by beating Efes Pilsen in the finals.
Fenerbahçe Ülker headed into the 2010–11 season with 5 new transfers: Engin Atsür, Šarūnas Jasikevičius, Marko Tomas, Kaya Peker, and Darjuš Lavrinovič.
New transfers for the 2011–12 season included: Bojan Bogdanović, Curtis Jerrells, James Gist, Hakan Demirel, and also Thabo Sefolosha, who returned to the NBA after the 2011 NBA lockout ended. With head coach Neven Spahija, Fenerbahçe Ülker became the Turkish League champions again. After two disappointing seasons, Željko Obradović was then signed as the team's head coach, and the roster was strengthened with the likes of former Toronto Raptor Linas Kleiza, promising power forward Nemanja Bjelica, consistent center Luka Žorić, and hot Turkish prospects Kenan Sipahi and Melih Mahmutoğlu. Fenerbahçe Ülker became the Turkish League champions again, after beating Galatasaray in the playoff's finals.
In the 2014–15 season, Fenerbahçe reached the Final Four of the Euroleague for the first time. In the Quarter-finals, Fenerbahçe knocked out Maccabi Tel Aviv with 3 straight wins. In the Semi-finals, the team lost to Real Madrid and eventually finished fourth. At the end of the season, the club's sponsorship agreement with Ülker ended. In the 2015–16 season, Fenerbahçe impressed in the Euroleague Regular Season and Top 16, and qualified once again for the Final Four tournament by eliminating the defending champions Real Madrid in the playoffs, again with a score of 3-0. During their first Final Four match against Laboral Kutxa, Fenerbahçe faced risking elimination once again before Kostas Sloukas made a game-tying lay-up to force the game into overtime, where Bogdan Bogdanović would help lead the team in overtime to win 88–77, being the first Turkish team to ever make it to the Euroleague Championship game. Their final opponent in the Euroleague competitions was CSKA Moscow, Fenerbahçe lost after overtime.
