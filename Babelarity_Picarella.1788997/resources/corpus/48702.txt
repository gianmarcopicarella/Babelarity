Réunion uses the flag of France. Although the federal period installed a number of flags of metropolitan France, Réunion does not have a separate official flag. However, the regional council of Réunion has a flag.
The Vexillological Association of Réunion selected a flag in 2003. It depicts the volcano of Fournaise, bedecked by gold sunbeams. It was designed in 1974 by Guy Pignolet who called it Lö Mahavéli but it really started to be promoted once the association chose it in 2003. It doesn't have official recognition but since 2014, it is flying on top of many public buildings after several city councils have taken the decision to do so.
Independentists and nationalists of Reunion also have their flag (green, yellow, red) which was created in 1986. Green symbolizes the marronage, yellow symbolizes the working class and red symbolizes the period of slavery and indentured labour, struck by a yellow star with five points.
