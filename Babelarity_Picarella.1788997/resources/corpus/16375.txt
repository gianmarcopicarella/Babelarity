On 26 March 2011, Thiago Heleno scored a double in a 3–0 Campeonato Paulista home win against Bragantino, which granted his team's qualification to the following round. He was released in December 2012, after the club's relegation.
In 2013 Thiago Heleno signed for Criciúma, but left the club in July after failing to make a single appearance for the club. On 15 January 2014 he joined Figueirense, winning promotion from Série B in his first season.
