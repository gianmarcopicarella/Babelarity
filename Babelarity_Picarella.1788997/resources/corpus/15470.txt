The 1993 Copa América was the 36th Copa América, CONMEBOL's football tournament for national teams. It was held in Ecuador between June 15 and July 4. All 10 CONMEBOL members took part, but for the first time two nations from outside CONMEBOL were invited to take part in the tournament, to round out the format. Mexico and the USA were the invited teams for this tournament. Argentina defeated Mexico in the final 2–1 to win their record 14th continental championship.
It was the first edition of the Copa América, in which neither Brazil nor Uruguay has finished in the top four. In 2015 and 2016, the similar situation occurred when both were knocked out before semifinals.

The teams were divided into three groups of four teams each. Each team plays one match against each of the other teams within the same group. Two (2) points are awarded for a win, one (1) point for a draw and zero (0) points for a defeat. First and second placed teams, in each group, advance to the quarter-finals. The two best third place teams also advance to the quarter-finals.
Tie-breaker
If teams finish leveled on points, the following tie-breakers are used:
greater goal difference in all group games;
greater number of goals scored in all group games;
winner of the head-to-head match between the teams in question;
drawing of lots.
At the end of the first stage, a comparison was made between the third-placed teams of each group. The two third-placed teams with the best results advanced to the quarter-finals.
With four goals, José Luis Dolgetta is the top scorer in the tournament. In total, 64 goals were scored by 41 different players, with only one of them credited as own goal.
