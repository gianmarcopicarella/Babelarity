Mariano Nicolás González (born 5 May 1981) is an Argentine footballer who plays for Club Atlético Huracán as an attacking midfielder or a winger.
Born in Tandil, Buenos Aires Province, González started his career at Racing Club de Avellaneda, arriving at 17 from neighbouring Club Atlético Independiente. He made his professional debuts at 21 under legendary Osvaldo Ardiles, and went on to appear in 64 Primera División matches, notably scoring the 4–3 winner against Boca Juniors.
In 2004 González left for Italy, signing with Serie A side U.S. Città di Palermo and going on to feature regularly during two seasons, especially the second. For the 2006–07 campaign he was loaned to Inter Milan, where he failed to break into the starting lineup, barred by the likes of Luís Figo and Dejan Stanković. Later, Inter opted not to renew the loan deal, and Palermo subsequently accepted a similar request by FC Porto on 17 July 2007.
After Ricardo Quaresma's sale to precisely Inter, González was acquired on a permanent basis by the Portuguese, for €3,25 million, rejoining former Palermo teammate (and countryman) Ernesto Farías, and began to feature more prominently, notabling scoring in the last minute to level it 2–2 at Manchester United, for the 2008–09 UEFA Champions League quarterfinals, while also being an important part of the northerners' back-to-back Primeira Liga conquests (he also won the competition while on loan).
After 2010–11 finished, González was released by Porto and joined Estudiantes de La Plata on a free transfer.
González won his first cap for Argentina in 2003, under Marcelo Bielsa. The following year he was summoned for the Copa América as the nation finished second, and also played olympic football at the 2004 Summer Olympics, winning gold.
González's younger brother, Pablo, is also a footballer. A striker, he too started his career at Racing Club, and spent several seasons in Italy.
