The 1932 Winter Olympics, officially known as the III Olympic Winter Games, were a winter multi-sport event in the United States, held in Lake Placid, New York. The games opened on February 4 and closed on February 15. It was the first of four Winter Olympics held in the United States; Lake Placid hosted again in 1980.
The Games were opened by Franklin D. Roosevelt, then the Governor of New York. He was elected President of the United States nine months later.
Irving Jaffee won the 5,000 m (3.1 mi) and the 10,000 m (6.2 mi) speedskating gold medals, beating previous champion and world record holder Ivar Ballangrud in the 10,000 m by 4.5 m (15 ft), mainly because the favourites were unaccustomed to the common start.
The USA won the medal tally with a total of 12 medals (6 gold, 4 silver, and 2 bronze).
Seventeen countries participated.
