Carlos Alberto Lacoste (1929–2004) was an Argentine navy vice-admiral and politician who briefly served as interim President of Argentina.
In addition to a naval career, Lacoste undertook the organization of the 1978 FIFA World Cup, hosted by Argentina.
In December 1981 the then head of state General Roberto Viola was ousted in a coup d'état. Lacoste served as interim President of Argentina from December 11 to December 22, 1981, during a period of military rule.
He was succeeded in the presidential office by Lieutenant General Leopoldo Galtieri.
After the military government, he preserved his connections with football associations, becoming a South American representative in FIFA, and in 1986 he was assigned as Argentine supervisor in the drawing of the that year's World Cup matches in Mexico, which was eventually won by Argentina.
He died in 2004.
