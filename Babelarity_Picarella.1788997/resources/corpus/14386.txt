Ognjen Koroman (Serbian Cyrillic: Огњен Короман, pronounced [ɔ̂ɡɲɛn kɔrɔ̌man]; born 19 September 1978 in Pale, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, Yugoslavia) is a retired Serbian international footballer. He represented Serbia and Montenegro at the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Koroman began his career at FK Radnički Kragujevac. He moved from OFK Beograd to Russian club Dynamo Moscow in 2002, and subsequently played for fellow Russian clubs FC Krylia Sovetov Samara and FC Terek Grozny, scoring 16 goals in 94 matches there.
In January 2006 Koroman moved to English club Portsmouth, scoring on the final day of the season against Liverpool. In August of the same year re-signed on a season long deal to Portsmouth. However, he spent much of the season on the bench. Allegedly, when Koroman asked coach Harry Redknapp why he insisted on staying at Portsmouth after a lackluster half-season, Redknapp replied, "There's two things that I like about you...you're not jealous of your [starting] teammates' success, and I see that you like to bet."
After seeing little action with Portsmouth, he signed for Red Star Belgrade on 6 February 2007 in a seven-month loan deal. In August 2007 he signed a 3-year contract with Red Star Belgrade. He also made a debut as team captain in the Serbian Superliga first round match against FK Čukarički Stankom, replacing Dejan Milovanović who was the team captain for the previous 18 months. In June 2009, he temporarily left Red Star Belgrade and signed a loan contract with Incheon United, coached by Ilija Petković until 2010. He returned to Red Star for the 2010–11 season.
He appeared in the 2006 World Cup for Serbia and Montenegro that included a performance against Holland. He was the subject of criticism during the tournament after he was yellow carded for twice waving an imaginary card and urging the referee to book an opponent.
