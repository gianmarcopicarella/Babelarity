Lunatica is a Swiss symphonic metal band, formed in Suhr, Switzerland in 1998.
Originally founded by keyboardist Alex Seiberl and guitarist Sandro D’Incau, lead vocalist Andrea Dätwyler joined the band in 2001, and their debut album Atlantis was released later that year. A series of concerts and festival appearances followed, and Lunatica was named "Best Newcomers" at the Swiss metal festival, Metaldayz.
Their second album Fables & Dreams followed in February 2004, produced by Sascha Paeth, renowned for his work with numerous successful European acts. “Fables & Dreams” debuted at #13 on the Swiss Internet Charts, and third album The Edge of Infinity followed in August 2006.
In 2008, guitarist André Leuenberger left the band, and was replaced by Marc Torretti. Most recently, Lunatica's fourth album New Shores was released in February 2009.
An as-yet untitled fifth album has been in production since 2010.
