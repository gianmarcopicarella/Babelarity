T Coronae Borealis (T CrB), informally nicknamed the Blaze Star, is a recurring nova in the constellation Corona Borealis. It normally has a magnitude of about 10, which is near the limit of typical binoculars. It has been seen to outburst twice, reaching magnitude 2.0 on May 12, 1866 and magnitude 3.0 on February 9, 1946. Though a more recent paper shows the 1866 outburst with a possible peak range of magnitude 2.5 Â± 0.5. Even when at peak magnitude of 2.5, this recurrent nova is dimmer than about 120 stars in the night sky.
On 20 April 2016, the Sky and Telescope newsletter reported a recent sustained brightening since February 2015 from magnitude 10.5 to about 9.2. A similar event was reported in 1938, shortly before the 1946 outburst. Closer observations are planned.
