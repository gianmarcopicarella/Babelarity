Randolph County was primarily settled by migrants from the Upper Southern states, especially Kentucky and Tennessee. They brought slaves and slaveholding traditions with them, and quickly started cultivating crops similar to those in Middle Tennessee and Kentucky: hemp and tobacco. Randolph was one of several counties settled mostly by Southerners to the north and south of the Missouri River. Given their culture and traditions, this area became known as Little Dixie, and Randolph County was at its heart.
Randolph County was home to Omar Bradley, the last of nine 5-star generals of the American military.
