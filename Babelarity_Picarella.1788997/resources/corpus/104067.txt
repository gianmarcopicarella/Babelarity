Chunky was named for a Choctaw Indian Village called Chanki Chitto. The name comes from an old Native-American game of Chunka, a corruption of the word Tuchungkee, which was a ball game played with Chunka Stones. An area nearby called Chunky Shoals on the Chunky River was where the games were believed to be played. Chunky was the southernmost town of the Choctaws which was visited by Tecumseh in 1811. The original white settlement of Chunky was called Chunkyville, and was adjacent to the Native-American settlement of Chunky Chitto. Chunkyville was established as a post office in 1848 with John G. Gallaspy serving as postmaster. In 1861, the A & V (Alabama and Vicksburg) Railroad was constructed two miles north of Chunkyville, and a depot built there was named Chunky. Chunkyville became extinct in 1868, when the post office was discontinued and the place was absorbed into the railroad town of Chunky in Newton County. The Jackson Military Road passed through what is now Chunky in 1816. In the early 1890s, the lumber industry was active in and around Chunky with sawmills, a turpentine still, a barrel factory and a large cotton gin being operated there. (Brieger, J. F., Hometown, Mississippi, p. 262,358). The only remnant of the original town of Chunkyville is the cemetery, currently known as St Mark Cemetery, where many of the residents are interred.

The Chunky River is the premier attraction for most people who visit Chunky. The river forms from the confluence of two creeks a few miles west of the town. The Chunky River is a hidden treasure with very little development along its shores, making it an attractive adventure to those who choose to canoe or kayak in it. While the river is shallow, occasionally, there are sections where the paddle will not reach the bottom. One such section is known as the "Deep Eddy". Otherwise, the river is seldom deeper than a few feet, and where there are mild rapids, the river may only be a few inches in depth. There is a public landing just east of town on the Highway 80 bridge, and another public landing 1/2 mile farther east on another Highway 80 bridge. This section of river is known as the "Seven Mile Bend", although it is scarcely over three miles (5 km) in length. The ability to put in and take out in very close proximity make this area the most highly used section of the river.
The Kansas City Southern Railroad goes through Chunky. Approximately 25 freight trains per day travel through the town. On each side of Chunky, there are 9,000-foot (2,700 m) sidings at Meehan Junction to the east, and Hickory to the west. The railroad crosses the Chunky River in two places just east of town, and between these two trestles is a very popular photography spot for train buffs to take photos of the trains as they cross the river. The railroad crosses the Chunky River west of town on a much smaller trestle, known locally as "break down". It was on this site that the trestle collapsed under a troop-carrying train of Confederate soldiers during the American Civil War; the wreck is called the Chunky Creek Train Wreck of 1863. A Confederate regiment of Choctaw Indians camping nearby saved many lives of soldiers who had been thrown into the raging flood swollen river.
