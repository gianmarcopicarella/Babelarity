The men's team archery competition at the 2012 Olympic Games in London was held from 27â€“28 July at Lord's Cricket Ground.
Italy won the gold medal with Michele Frangilli, Marco Galiazzo and Mauro Nespoli. The United States won silver and South Korea won bronze.
The teams were ranked 1st to 12th based on the three team members' ranking round results and this was used to seed them into a head-to-head knockout bracket. Each member of the team shot eight arrows in a match (for a total of 24 arrows per team) and the team with the highest total won the match. The winner advanced to the next round while the loser was eliminated from the competition.
All times are British Summer Time (UTC+1).
