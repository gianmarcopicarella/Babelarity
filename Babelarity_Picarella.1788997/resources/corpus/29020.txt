Almaraz is a town in CÃ¡ceres Province, Extremadura, Spain. As of 2005, its population is 1,295. It is on the European route E90. It is the home of the Almaraz Nuclear Power Plant. A solar power macroplant is being built in the town.
The bridge over the Tagus at Almaraz was built by Emperor Carlos I in the 16th Century and was known by the local people as the Albalat Bridge; however, it was destroyed by the Spanish on March 14, 1809 to prevent its use by the French during the Peninsular War. In the Battle of Almaraz on 18/19 May 1812, the Anglo-Portuguese Army under Lord Hill destroyed a French pontoon bridge across the Tagus which was protected by two French garrisons at either end.
Later, the old bridge at Almaraz has been repaired and can be driven across.
