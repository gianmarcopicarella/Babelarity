Luena (pre-1975: Luso) is a town located in east central Angola. It is the administrative capital of Moxico Province. While no exact figures are available, estimates on the population of the city varies from 60,000 to 200,000 residents, including an unknown number of refugees from the Angolan Civil War that officially ended in 2002.
The Angolan town is best known as the resting place of former UNITA rebel leader Jonas Savimbi, who was shot and killed in military conflict with Angolan government troops on February 22, 2002. Later on January 3, 2008, Savimbi's tomb was vandalised and four members of the youth wing of the MPLA were charged and arrested.
