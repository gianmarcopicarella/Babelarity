Alistair Edward Brownlee, MBE (born 23 April 1988) is a British triathlete, and the current Olympic, European and Commonwealth champion in his sport, having won the gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics and the 2014 Commonwealth Games. He is a two-time Triathlon World Champion, winning in 2009 and again in 2011, a 2 time World Team Champion (2011, 2014) and a 3 time European Champion. His brother, Jonathan Brownlee, is also a triathlon champion, placing third in the 2012 Olympics, winning the 2012 World Championship and the last World Sprint Triathlon Championship, in addition to accompanying his brother in their World and Commonwealth mixed team relay victories.
Brownlee was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to triathlon.
Brownlee was educated at Bradford Grammar School, a co-educational independent school in the city of Bradford in Yorkshire, followed by Girton College, Cambridge, where he started a medicine degree. After just the first eight-week term, Brownlee decided to leave and instead went to the University of Leeds, where he gained a degree in Sports Science and Physiology in 2010. He is now studying for an MSc in Finance at Leeds Metropolitan University.
Brownlee was introduced to triathlon at a young age by his uncle, Simon Hearnshaw, who regularly competed in the sport. As a junior, he was a successful fell and cross country runner, coming second in the Junior English Cross Country Championships and winning the Yorkshire County title on several occasions.
Brownlee has said that "It was only when I won the World Junior Championships in 2006 that I made the conscious decision to really focus on triathlon". Subsequently, Brownlee left Girton College, Cambridge where he was reading medicine, to move back to Yorkshire, focus on triathlon and study at the University of Leeds. He described his decision to leave Cambridge to a student newspaper there in 2013, saying "trying to fit 30+ hours of training around my degree was pretty impossible. I decided that triathlon was my true passion, so I moved back to study at Leeds on a less demanding course, and in a city where the sport was well supported at the time by British Triathlon". He is a member of the triathlon club based at Leeds Metropolitan University's Carnegie High Performance centre, and is coached by Carnegie Director of Sport Malcolm Brown, and in swimming by Jack Maitland.
Brownlee has two brothers, Edward and Jonathan. His younger brother Jonathan is also a triathlete, and won the bronze medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics.
Brownlee represented Great Britain at the 2008 Summer Olympics in the triathlon event, finishing in 12th place and first British competitor. During the 2008 season, his best world cup finish was 3rd place in Madrid and he also won the under-23 world championship.
Brownlee won the 2009 ITU Triathlon World Championship – winning all five of the season's ITU World Championship Series events in which he competed. He was victorious in Madrid, Washington D.C, Kitzbühel and London before winning the 2009 season Grand Final, held on Australia's Gold Coast on 12 September and thereby became the first person ever to win the ITU world Triathlon titles for Junior Men (2006), Under 23 Men (2008) and Senior Men (2009).
During the 2010 off season, Brownlee sustained a stress fracture of the femur and wasn't able to return to competition until June, which made defence of his ITU title almost impossible. He did however mark his return to competitive triathlon with a convincing win in Madrid, followed a month later with the European Triathlon Union (ETU) Championships title. Collapsing with exhaustion at the London race, in late July, meant that despite also going on to win the final race of the 2010 ITU Series, in Budapest, he lost his overall World Championship title to Javier Gómez.
In the April opening event of the 2011 ITU Championship season in Sydney, Brownlee suffered a heavy fall while in the lead which brought early disappointment and a 29th-place finish. This was contrasted with outstanding success when, in the space of just twenty-one days during June 2011, Brownlee convincingly won the next two ITU series events (in Madrid and Kitzbühel) and, following a puncture whilst in the lead and having to make up more than 30 seconds on the new leaders, successfully defended his European title at the 2011 Pontevedra ETU Triathlon European Championships and shared the podium with his brother Jonathan, who took the silver medal. Brownlee won the 2011 ITU world title after winning the Grand Final in Beijing and the gold medal at the London 2012 Olympics on 7 August while his brother finished in 3rd, taking the bronze medal.
Ali won the Commonwealth Games Triathlon in 2014, controlling the race with his brother Jonny, from the start, before pulling away on the 1st lap of the run in dominating style. Jonny took Silver.
Brownlee also took gold in the mixed triathlon team relay at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, with brother Jonathan, Vicky Holland and Jodie Stimpson.

In 2010, only the femur fracture could slow Brownlee's dominance for some time. At the opening triathlon in Dunkirk (23 May 2010), Alistair was not present, his brother Jonathan won the gold medal. At Beauvais (13 June 2010) Alistair placed 9th. At the Triathlon de Paris (18 July 2010), however, and at Tourangeaux (29 August 2010), Brownlee won the gold medals again. At the Grand Final in La Baule (Triathlon Audencia, 18 September 2010), Alistair placed 2nd, Jonathan 3rd, and their rival Javier Gómez Noya could win gold.
In 2011, Brownlee took part in the French Club Championship Series Lyonnaise des Eaux representing the club EC Sartrouville, which, thanks to the Brownlee brothers and Javier Gómez Noya, had already won the Club Championship in 2010. At Nice (24 April 2011), Dunkirk (22 May 2011), and Paris (9 July 2011) Brownlee was the winner.
