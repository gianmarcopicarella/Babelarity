The Zanzibar national football team is the national team of Zanzibar, and is controlled by the Zanzibar Football Association.
Zanzibar is not a member of FIFA and is therefore not eligible to enter the World Cup. However, as a member of the CAF, it can take a part in the Africa Cup of Nations. The island is part of the nation of Tanzania which holds FIFA recognition at the international level. Prior to the union of Zanzibar and Tanganyika in 1964, Zanzibar was a fully independent member of the Confederation of African Football (CAF), but never qualified for the African Nations Cup. It was also an associate member of FIFA between 2007 and 2009.
Zanzibar is currently a provisional member of the N.F.-Board. The team placed 2nd in the 2006 FIFI Wild Cup tournament, losing 4-1 on penalties to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in the final. For that tournament, they were coached by the German comedian Oliver Pocher.
Their U-20 team also played in the 2006 ELF Cup, finishing fourth of eight, winning one game (1-0 against Kyrgyzstan's national futbal team) and drawing twice (against Gagauzia and Greenland) before losing 5-0 to Northern Cyprus in the semifinal. They regularly play in the CECAFA Cup, which includes national teams from Central and East Africa, and in 1995 they became champions, winning the final match 1-0 against the host nation, Uganda. In the 2015 CECAFA Cup they won by defeating Kenya 3-1
On 18 July 2010, Zanzibar had to start afresh and find a new coach after the newly recruited Briton, Stewart Hall, was forced to terminate his contract for technical reasons.
