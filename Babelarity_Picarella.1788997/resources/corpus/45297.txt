Live Shit: Binge & Purge is a live album by the American heavy metal band Metallica. It was the band's first live album and was released in a box set format on November 23, 1993. The initial first pressings contained three CDs or cassette tapes, with songs from concerts in Mexico City on the Nowhere Else to Roam tour, as well as three VHS tapes and a black T-shirt, while a newer version contains two DVDs from concerts in San Diego on the Wherever We May Roam Tour and Seattle on the Damaged Justice Tour. It was originally released as a cardboard box depicting the style of a typical tour equipment transport box. Besides the audio and video media, the box featured additional bonus material (booklet showing photos, typical tour correspondence as sent and received by the band and their management, and internal documents and handwritten notes; a recreated copy of an access pass to the "Snakepit" part of the tour stage; a cardboard drawing/airbrush stencil for the "Scary Guy" logo) and a black "Metalli'Fukin'ca" T-shirt. Live Shit: Binge & Purge has been certified 15x platinum by the RIAA as a long-form video format.
