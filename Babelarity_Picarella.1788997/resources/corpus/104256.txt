The Boeing Business Jet series are variants of Boeing jet airliners for the corporate jet market. The Boeing Business Jet is a 50/50 partnership between Boeing Commercial Airplanes and GE Aviation.
The BBJ designation denotes the business jets based upon the 737 series airliners. These aircraft usually seats between 25 and 50 passengers within a luxurious configuration. This may include a master bedroom, a washroom with showers, a conference/dining area, and a living area. Boeing Business Jets also has corporate jet configurations based on the Boeing 777, Boeing 787 and the Boeing 747-8 Intercontinental, which are known as 777 VIP, 787 VIP, and 747-8 VIP, respectively.
The Boeing BBJ is primarily a 737 commercial airframe with modifications to provide for private jet service. The BBJ1 is based on a 737-700 airframe, with elements from the 737–800. The BBJ2 and BBJ3 are based on the 737–800 and 737-900ER series, respectively.
All 11 models include changes to the airframe regardless of the BBJ series. Fokker Services are developing 1.5 meter wide windows for the BBJ in 2016.
Changes from the normal 737 include:
Blended winglets for additional fuel economy (3–5% improvement) as standard (winglets are optional on airliner 737s)
Self-contained airstairs for disembarking at airports with limited ground support
Additional fuel tanks, for intercontinental range
ETOPS-180 certification
After the launch of the BBJ, Airbus followed suit with the launch of the Airbus ACJ derived from its A319 commercial airframe. It has also launched the larger A320 and the smaller A318 Elite. Other competitors at the smaller end of the market include the Embraer Lineage, the Bombardier Global Express, the Gulfstream G550 and the Gulfstream G650. A BBJ may cost around US$10/mile to operate, whereas the G650 and similar may cost $5–6.
BBJ, or less frequently BBJ1, is based on the 737-700, and formed the basis for the 737-700ER. This was the initial variant. In United States Air Force service, this is known as the C-40B Clipper.
BBJ2 is based on the 737–800.
BBJ3 is based on the 737-900ER.
BBJ C is a variant of the BBJ featuring the "quick change" capabilities of the 737-700C. This allows the aircraft to be used for executive duty during one flight, and to be quickly reconfigured for cargo duty for the next flight.
BBJ MAX 8 and BBJ MAX 9 are proposed variants of the Boeing 737 MAX 8 and 9.
