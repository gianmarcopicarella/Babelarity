Edwin Carr MNZM (10 August 1926 – 27 March 2003) was a composer of classical music from New Zealand.
Edwin Carr was born in Auckland and was educated at Otago Boys' High School from 1940 to 1943. He studied music at Otago University from 1944–5 and Auckland University College from 1946, then left with his degree unfinished. In 1946 he attended the first Cambridge Summer Music School with Douglas Lilburn as his composition tutor. In 1948 he travelled to England on a New Zealand Government Bursary, to study composition at the Guildhall with Benjamin Frankel. During this time he did much freelance work, travelled widely and met Geoffrey Grey.
In 1954 a British Council scholarship enabled him to study under Petrassi in Rome. He also worked in Italy as the musical director of an independent ballet company. In 1957 a further British Council scholarship enabled him to study with Carl Orff in Munich. In 1958 he returned to New Zealand, staying there until 1960 teaching and composing.
During the 1960s he spent time in both Australia and England, composing, teaching and studying as well as several trips to New Zealand.
In 1973–74 he was awarded the Mozart Fellowship at the University of Otago. From 1975–76 he taught composition at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music before returning to London in 1976. He returned to Australia in 1977 and taught part-time at the Sydney Conservatorium. In 1984 he returned to Taupo, New Zealand where he composed and conducted freelance.
From 1991 Carr lived on Waiheke Island where he was still active as a composer. In 1999 he was made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the Queen's Birthday Honours. Edwin Carr died at his home on Waiheke Island on 27 March 2003.
