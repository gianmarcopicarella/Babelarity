Eta2 Hydri (η2 Hyi, η2 Hydri), often catalogued as HD 11977, is a giant yellow star approximately 219 light-years away in the constellation of Hydrus. Based on its mass, it was probably a class A star (similar to Vega or Fomalhaut) when it was on the main sequence, though it is now in the giant stage of its evolution. It is thought to be around 1.3 billion years old and has expanded to 10 times the Sun's diameter, though is only around 1.8 times as massive as the Sun. As of 2005, an extrasolar planet was confirmed to be orbiting the star.
In 2005, the giant planet Eta2 Hydri b was found in orbit around Eta2 Hydri.
