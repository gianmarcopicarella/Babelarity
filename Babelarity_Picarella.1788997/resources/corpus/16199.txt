Charles Meldrum Daniels (March 24, 1885 â€“ August 9, 1973) was an American competition swimmer, eight-time Olympic medalist, and world record-holder in two freestyle swimming events. Daniels was an innovator of the front crawl swimming style, inventing the "American crawl".
Daniels began his swimming career with the New York Athletic Club in 1903. At the 1904 Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, Daniels became the first American to win an Olympic medal, winning gold medals in both the 220- and 440-yard freestyle races. Four years later, at the 1908 Olympics in London, Daniels won gold in the 100-meter freestyle.
Daniels was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame as an "Honor Swimmer" in 1965.
