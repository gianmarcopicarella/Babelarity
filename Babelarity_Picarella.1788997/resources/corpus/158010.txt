Summit County is a county located in the U.S. state of Utah, occupying a rugged and mountainous area. As of the 2010 census, the population was 36,324. Its county seat is Coalville, and the largest city is Park City. The county was created in 1854 and later organized in 1861. It is so named because it includes 39 of the highest mountain peaks in Utah.
The county's mean elevation is 8,388 feet (2,557 m) above sea level, which is the second-highest of any county outside Colorado. Owing to its proximity to Salt Lake City, Park City has acquired a reputation as an upscale getaway, bringing new development to the area.

Summit County has traditionally been a Republican stronghold. In recent years, however, it has become more competitive, and Democrats have at times won a plurality or even a majority of the votes. Although George W. Bush carried the county in 2000 and 2004, his performance there was his worst in the state. In a 2006 U.S. Senate race, Summit County was the only county carried by Democrat Pete Ashdown even as the Republican incumbent Orrin Hatch carried the state as a whole by a 2 to 1 margin. Likewise, in the 2008 U.S. Presidential election, Barack Obama carried the county by a 15.3% margin over John McCain, while McCain carried Utah by 28.1% over Obama. However, in the 2012 presidential election, Republican Mitt Romney defeated Obama in the county, 51% to 46%.
On the county level, most of the elected offices are held by Democrats; including four of the five seats on the newly created Summit County Council. -John Hanrahan, D; Claudia McMullin, D; Sally Elliott, D; Chris Robinson, D; David Ure, R
