39th World Artistic Gymnastics Championships were held in Aarhus, Denmark from October 13 to October 21, 2006 in NRGi Arena.
The International Gymnastics Federation, which celebrated the 125th anniversary of its foundation in 2006, introduced the new Code of Points into the World Championships for the first time. The new open-ended code consists of separate scores for the difficulty and execution of an exercise, removing the "perfect 10" as the standard.
2006 brought the first ever gold medal to the Italian women's program, for Vanessa Ferrari in the individual all-around.
