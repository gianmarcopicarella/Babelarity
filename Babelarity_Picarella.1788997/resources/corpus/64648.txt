In the mathematical field of complex analysis, a pole of a meromorphic function is a certain type of singularity that behaves like the singularity of 
            1
              z
                n
    {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{z^{n}}}}
   at z = 0. For a pole of the function f(z) at point a the function approaches infinity as z approaches a.
Formally, suppose U is an open subset of the complex plane C, p is an element of U and f : U \ {p} → C is a function which is holomorphic over its domain. If there exists a holomorphic function g : U → C, such that g(p) is nonzero, and a positive integer n, such that for all z in U \ {p}
        f
        (
        z
        )
        =
              g
              (
              z
              )
              (
              z
              −
              p
                )
                  n
    {\displaystyle f(z)={\frac {g(z)}{(z-p)^{n}}}}
holds, then p is called a pole of f. The smallest such n is called the order of the pole. A pole of order 1 is called a simple pole.
A few authors allow the order of a pole to be zero, in which case a pole of order zero is either a regular point or a removable singularity. However, it is more usual to require the order of a pole to be positive.
From above several equivalent characterizations can be deduced:
If n is the order of pole p, then necessarily g(p) ≠ 0 for the function g in the above expression. So we can put
        f
        (
        z
        )
        =
            1
              h
              (
              z
              )
    {\displaystyle f(z)={\frac {1}{h(z)}}}
for some h that is holomorphic in an open neighborhood of p and has a zero of order n at p. So informally one might say that poles occur as reciprocals of zeros of holomorphic functions.
Also, by the holomorphy of g, f can be expressed as:
        f
        (
        z
        )
        =
              a
                −
                n
              (
              z
              −
              p
                )
                  n
        +
        ⋯
        +
              a
                −
                1
              (
              z
              −
              p
              )
        +
          ∑
            k
            ≥
            0
          a
            k
        (
        z
        −
        p
          )
            k
        .
    {\displaystyle f(z)={\frac {a_{-n}}{(z-p)^{n}}}+\cdots +{\frac {a_{-1}}{(z-p)}}+\sum _{k\,\geq \,0}a_{k}(z-p)^{k}.}
This is a Laurent series with finite principal part. The holomorphic function 
            ∑
              k
              ≥
              0
            a
              k
          (
          z
          −
          p
            )
              k
    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle \sum _{k\,\geq \,0}a_{k}(z\,-\,p)^{k}}
   (on U) is called the regular part of f. So the point p is a pole of order n of f if and only if all the terms in the Laurent series expansion of f around p below degree −n vanish and the term in degree −n is not zero.
A complex function can be defined as having a pole at the point at infinity. In this case U has to be a neighborhood of infinity, such as the exterior of any closed ball. To use the previous definition, a meaning for g being holomorphic at ∞ is needed. Alternately, a definition can be given starting from the definition at a finite point by suitably mapping the point at infinity to a finite point. The map 
          z
          ↦
              1
              z
    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle z\mapsto {\frac {1}{z}}}
   does that. Then, by definition, a function f holomorphic in a neighborhood of infinity has a pole at infinity if the function 
          f
          (
              1
              z
          )
    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle f({\frac {1}{z}})}
   (which will be holomorphic in a neighborhood of 
          z
          =
          0
    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle z=0}
  ), has a pole at 
          z
          =
          0
    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle z=0}
  , the order of which will be regarded as the order of the pole of f at infinity.
In general, having a function 
          f
          :
          M
          →
            C
    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle f:\;M\,\rightarrow \,\mathbb {C} }
   that is holomorphic in a neighborhood, 
          U
    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle U}
  , of the point 
          a
    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle a}
  , in the complex manifold M, it is said that f has a pole at a of order n if, having a chart 
          ϕ
          :
          U
          →
            C
    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle \phi :\;U\,\rightarrow \,\mathbb {C} }
  , the function 
          f
          ∘
            ϕ
              −
              1
          :
            C
          →
            C
    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle f\,\circ \,\phi ^{-1}:\;\mathbb {C} \,\rightarrow \,\mathbb {C} }
   has a pole of order n at 
          ϕ
          (
          a
          )
    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle \phi (a)}
   (which can be taken as being zero if a convenient choice of the chart is made). ] The pole at infinity is the simplest nontrivial example of this definition in which M is taken to be the Riemann sphere and the chart is taken to be 
          ϕ
          (
          z
          )
          =
              1
              z
    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle \phi (z)\,=\,{\frac {1}{z}}}
  .

            z
    {\displaystyle f(z)={\frac {3}{z}}}
has a pole of order 1 or simple pole at 
        z
        =
        0
    {\displaystyle z=0}

The function

has a pole of order 2 at 
        z
        =

    {\displaystyle z=5}
   and a pole of order 3 at

              −
              1
    {\displaystyle f(z)={\frac {z-4}{e^{z}-1}}}
has poles of order 1 at 
        z
        =
        2
        π
        n

        …
        .
    {\displaystyle z\,=\,2\pi ni{\text{ for }}n\,=\,\dots ,\,-1,\,0,\,1,\,\dots .}
   To see that, write 
          e
            z
    {\displaystyle e^{z}}
   in Taylor series around the origin.
The function
        f
        (
        z
        )
        =
        z
    {\displaystyle f(z)=z}
has a single pole at infinity of order 1.
If the first derivative of a function f has a simple pole at a, then a is a branch point of f. (The converse need not be true).
A non-removable singularity that is not a pole or a branch point is called an essential singularity.
A complex function which is holomorphic except for some isolated singularities and whose only singularities are poles is called meromorphic.
