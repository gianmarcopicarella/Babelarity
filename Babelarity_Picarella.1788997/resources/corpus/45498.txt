Symbol of Life is the ninth studio album recorded by British band Paradise Lost. It marks a departure by the band from their synth-based approach and returning to a much heavier sound, although not abandoning the keyboards altogether. This album was the final release featuring drummer Lee Morris. Two songs which were written and left out for this album are "I Can Hate You" and "Deus" have not been released on any of the reissues of this album, but are on the Digipak version of the single "Erased". The aforementioned single has a Music video. "Isolate" is also another single.
