Orson was a Brit Award-winning American rock band from Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, formed in 2000.
Originally the band called itself Halogen. Their self-financed debut studio album, Bright Idea, released by Mercury Records in 2006, was produced in Los Angeles by Noah Shain and achieved chart success in the UK with the first single, "No Tomorrow". The album and single both debuted at number 1 (UK). Bright Idea went Platinum in the UK charts and has gone on to sell just under a million copies worldwide.
The band first performed on UK radio during a live session on BBC Radio 2's Dermot O'Leary Show. Later, when they appeared at the 2006 Virgin Mobile V Festival in Staffordshire and Chelmsford in the UK, lead singer Jason Pebworth exclaimed, "It's good to be home!" This is because the band moved to London from Los Angeles in 2006.
Lead singer Jason Pebworth said in an interview that the band's musical influences are Led Zeppelin, Flaming Lips, Beck and Bj√∂rk.
Other UK television appearances include Concert for Diana, Top of the Pops, Pop World, 1 Leicester Square MTV UK w/Russell Brand, Sharon Osbourne Show, The Charlotte Church Show, Davina and Top Gear.
In 2007, Orson won the Brit Award for Best International Breakthrough Act.
Orson have toured as support act for Duran Duran, Robbie Williams and Basement Jaxx as well as headlined their own UK tours multiple times from 2006-2007. Festivals they have played include Fuji Rock, T in the Park, Oxegen, V Festival, Pukkelpop and Lowlands.
Signed to Universal Publishing, Pebworth and George Astasio remain successful writers and producers under the name The Invisible Men, along with colleague Jon Shave, formerly of Xenomania. They have already had hits with artists like The Noisettes and Gabriella Cilmi, and also work with Iggy Azalea and Jessie J.
Johnny Lonely continues to perform as well as managing new artists as 'Lo Pro' in Los Angeles, and performed with Roentgen on the Hott Mess EP.
Chris Cano works continuously as a drummer and toured with mega-band Ozomatli.
