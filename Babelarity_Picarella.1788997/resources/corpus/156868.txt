La Baronia de Rialb (Catalan pronunciation: [ɫə βəɾuˈni.ə ðə riˈaɫp], locally: [la βaɾoˈni.a ðe riˈaɫp]) is a municipality in the comarca (county) of the Noguera in Catalonia, Spain. The territory is crossed by the river Rialb and the river Segre. The capital city is Gualter, before it had been La Torre de Rialb.
The municipality is formed by the union of old and tiny hamlets and parishes which in total accounts for twenty-three Romanesque churches, which is the largest number of such churches in Catalonia.
The agricultural sector is still what draws the most numbers of jobs in La Baronia. A country with blueprints irrigated, highly arable lands, with a level of approximately 400 m to over 800 m altitude of usable land is suitable for a wide variety of crops. However, since a few years ago, the tourism sector is becoming the economic boost that the valley needed. In fact, there are currently available a two dozen agritourist establishments.
