Robert Esmie (born July 5, 1972) was a Canadian sprinter and member of the 1996 Summer Olympics Gold medal 4x100 m relay.
Born in Jamaica and raised in Sudbury, Ontario, Esmie, Glenroy Gilbert, Bruny Surin and Donovan Bailey were the nucleus of a formidable 4x100 m relay team in the mid-1990s.
Esmie placed seventh (10.23) in the second semi-final of the 100m and won a bronze medal in 4x100 m relay at the 1993 World Championships. At the 1994 Commonwealth Games, Esmie was a member of the gold medal team in the 4x100 m relay.
Esmie won a bronze medal in the 60 m at the 1995 World Indoor Championships and was again a member of gold medal winning Canadian 4x100 m relay team at the 1995 World Championships.
At the Atlanta Olympics the Canadian men's 4x100 relay team was not favored despite winning most high profile titles in the previous three years, including the 1995 World Championships. Leading up the Olympics, the United States team of Jon Drummond, Tim Harden, Michael Marsh and Dennis Mitchell claimed they would beat Canada, however in 4x100 relay final the Canadian team beat the United States by almost half a second to win the gold in national record time. Esmie was not originally slated to run with the relay team, but replaced Carlton Chambers the night before the race after Chambers suffered a groin injury in the 200m.
Esmie's gold medal was later stolen.
Esmie and the Canadian team won a gold medal again at the 1997 World Championships.
In 2008 he was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame as part of the 1996 Summer Olympics 4x100 relay team.
