The Nokia 3310 is a GSM mobile phone announced on September 1, 2000, and released in the fourth quarter of the year, replacing the popular Nokia 3210. The phone sold extremely well, being one of the most successful phones with 126 million units sold worldwide. The phone is still widely acclaimed today.
Several variants of the 3310 have been released, including the Nokia 3315, 3320, 3330, 3350, 3360, 3390 and 3395.
The 3310 was developed at the Copenhagen Nokia site in Denmark. It is a compact and sturdy phone featuring an 84 × 48 pixel pure monochrome display. It has a lighter 115 g battery variant which has fewer features; for example the 133 g battery version has the start-up image of two hands touching while the 115 g version does not. It is a slightly rounded rectangular unit that is typically held in the palm of a hand, with the buttons operated with the thumb. The blue button is the main button for selecting options, with "C" button as a "back" or "undo" button. Up and down buttons are used for navigation purposes. The on/off/profile button is a stiff black button located on the top of the phone. The 3310 is known for being reasonably durable due to its casing and construction, a feature which is often humorously exaggerated in internet communities. Numerous videos also exist of the phone being put through damage tests to test the phone's strength, including being dropped from a great height and being crushed by heavy objects.
The 3310 is known for having many features that were rare for the time. These include many utilities, such as a calculator, Nokia network monitor, stop watch and a reminder function. It has four games: Pairs II, Space Impact, Bantumi, and the hugely popular Snake II. The Snake series of games had been popular on Nokia handsets since the late 1990s.
The 3310 was popular for SMS text messaging because it allowed long messages three times the size of a standard SMS text message, at 459 characters. It also featured threaded SMS writing, SMS Chat. The phone also has voice dialing for the quick dialing of selected numbers.
The Nokia 3310 can be customized with interchangeable Xpress-On covers, and thousands of different designs have been produced by various companies. It also has over 35 ringtones built in with space for seven custom tones. These can either be downloaded, or can be composed by the user using the tone composer. The phone has different "profiles" which can adjust the phone to different sets of preferences. For example, there is silent mode where the phone will not ring, useful for situations where it is inappropriate to do so. Screensavers can be made from received picture messages.
An enhanced version of the 3310 is the Nokia 3315 which has some additional features:
A picture editor to edit pictures for use in SMS Picture messaging & screensavers on the phone
Timed profiles
Could use received ring tones as SMS tones
Fixed some of the bugs found in the 3310
Automatic keypad locking after specified time
Peanut-like inter-connected silicon keymat
Singaporean and Malaysian sold 3315s also had a blue backlight for the LCD screen and keypad, as opposed to green.
Similar design to its successor (The Nokia 3410)
The 3315 was also released in Australia. Most versions of the 3310 could be upgraded to include the additional features of the 3315 by using a data cable.
There are two North American variants of the 3310; one is the Nokia 3390, which operates on GSM 1900. The Nokia 3395 is an updated version of the 3390 which includes the additional features of the Asian 3315 model, and it has poor reception if you are in a GSM 850 area.
The Nokia 3330 added a CSD-based WAP capability, animated screensavers, a pinball game named 'Bumper' and phonebook (stored in the phone memory as opposed to the SIM card in earlier models) with a 100 entry capacity to the model. It also has the capability of downloading Java MIDP apps via WAP (Snake II mazes, Bumper tables, Space Impact chapters).
An Asia Pacific-only version, known as the Nokia 3350, was in essence an improved 3330 with WAP, rhythmic backlight alert, animated screensavers, two-way Navi-Key, dedicated call and hang buttons, Chinese lunar calendar and a 96×65-pixel screen. Some 3350s have back covers that feature a photo-insert window, allowing users to put personal pictures from photographs, magazine cut-outs, etc.
The Nokia 3360 and 3320 are related models designed for the U.S. and Canadian markets respectively. They are externally similar to the 3310 and 3390, but use Digital AMPS ("TDMA")/AMPS technology rather than GSM.
Like the Asian 3350, they include two dedicated call and hang buttons and two soft keys. They also feature an infrared port. Unlike the 3390, the 3360 and 3320 do not support voice dialing. At 136 gram each, they are also slightly heavier than the 3390, which weighs 119 gram.
For April Fools' Day in 2014, an article was posted on Microsoft's Lumia Conversations website, announcing that the 3310 was getting a Windows Phone makeover, complete with a 41-megapixel camera (the same as the one built into the Lumia 1020) and multiple colors. The joke kept elements of the phone intact, such as the overall design and original ringtones and games, but gave it a new screen similar to those found in current phones, the navigation buttons used by all Windows Phones (but physical buttons as opposed to touch-sensitive ones, to stay true to the original design), as well as a modified version of the Windows Phone 8 firmware. Even the name was kept the same as the original.
In November 2015, Nokia 3310 was chosen as one of the first three 'National Emojis' for Finland. The emoji is referred as 'The Unbreakable' as the phone was known for its toughness. To mark the fame of the device, Finland, the country in which the phone was designed and manufactured has taken this decision.
