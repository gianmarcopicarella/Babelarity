Sacha Modolo (born 19 June 1987) is an Italian racing cyclist who rides for Lampre–Merida.
In the spring of 2010, he sprinted his way to fourth place in the cycling monument Milan – San Remo, registering a prestigious placing. He followed the near-wins of 2010 with victories in 2011, seemingly akin to winning stages in pair in races such as the Danmark Rundt, the Tour of Qinghai Lake, the Settimana Ciclistica Lombarda and the Giro di Padania. In 2012, as he and his teammates were competing for a spot at the start of the Giro d'Italia, Modolo won stage 6 of the Tour of Turkey with a sprint. When he crossed the line, he put his thumb in his mouth, dedicating his victory to his pregnant girlfriend.
In 2013, Modolo started the year by winning the second stage of the Tour de San Luis, beating fellow sprinter Mark Cavendish (Omega Pharma–Quick-Step) on the slightly uphill finish which featured some twist and turns. Modolo admitted after the stage that he learned about the specifics of the arrival by chatting with other riders during the race.
Modolo left Bardiani Valvole–CSF Inox at the end of the 2013 season, and joined Lampre–Merida for the 2014 season. In 2015, Modolo opened his account on the fifth stage of the Tour of Turkey, winning the sprint on the rising finishing straight. He banked his first two victories in a Grand Tour at the Giro d'Italia, Stages 13 and 16. He said of his victory on Stage 13 that it was his destiny to win in Jesolo since it is his home region.
