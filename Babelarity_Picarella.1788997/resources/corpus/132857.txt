In Greek mythology, Zelus or Zelos /ˈziːləs/ (Greek: Ζῆλος, Zēlos, literally "zeal") was the son of Pallas and Styx. Zelus and siblings Nike (Victory), Kratos (Strength) and Bia (Force) were winged enforcers who stood in attendance at Zeus' throne and formed part of his retinue.
Zelus personifies dedication, emulation, eager rivalry, envy, jealousy, and zeal. The English word "zeal" is derived from his name.
Zelos may have also been identified with Agon, and was closely connected with Eris.
