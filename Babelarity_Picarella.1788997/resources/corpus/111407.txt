Atlanersa was a Nubian king who ruled around 653 to 640 BC as the successor of Tantamani, the last ruler of the 25th Nubian dynasty in Egypt.
In contrast to his predecessor, Atlanersa's kingdom was restricted to the region of Kush south of Elephantine. Nevertheless, he did adopt the titles of the Egyptian pharaohs.
Atlanersa was the son of king Taharqa or possibly Tantamani. His mother was a queen whose name is not fully preserved, but ended with ...salka. Atlanersa was married to his two sisters: Yeturow and Khaliset. Further wives may include Malotaral - mother of his successor Senkamanisken- and Peltasen. A lady whose name is only partially preserved: Taba[..], may be another consort.
Atlanersa is known from depictions and a granite stand found in the temple of Jebel Barkal. An altar was also found there inscribed with his name. At Dongola, the fragment of an obelisk was discovered with his name. He was buried in pyramid Nu. 20 at Nuri.
