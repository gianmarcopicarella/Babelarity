Pietro Caucchioli (born 28 August 1975 in Bovolone, Veneto) is an Italian professional road racing cyclist. Caucchioli is under suspension, since June 2009, following abnormal testing results within the Union Cycliste Internationale's biological passport system.
His two-stage wins at the 2001 Giro d'Italia and a podium finish (3rd place) at the 2002 Giro are his finest career accomplishments.
On 3 June 2010 he was sanctioned by the UCI on the basis of his biological passport.
