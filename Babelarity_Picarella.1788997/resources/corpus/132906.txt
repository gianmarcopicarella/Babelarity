Triglav (Bosnian, Croatian, Slovenian and Serbian Latin: Triglav; Ukrainian, Russian, Macedonian, Bulgarian and Serbian Cyrillic: Триглав; Czech and Slovak: Trihlav; Polish: Trygław, Trzygłów; Belarusian:Трыглаў) (meaning 'three headed') also sometimes called troglav is a deity in Slavic mythology.
Mount Triglav, the highest mountain in Slovenia, is unlikely to have any connection to the Slavic deity Triglav. However, such a claim is made for Mount Troglav, the highest peak of Dinara in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Triglav is alegedly depicted as representation of three major Slavic gods that vary from one Slavic tribe to others that serve as the representatives of the above mentioned realms. An early variation included Svarog, Perun, and Dazhbog. Later, Dajbog was replaced by Svetovid or Veles. Triglav is usually described as a fusion of these gods. Triglav is depicted as a three-headed man sometimes with bands of (gold) blindfolds over his eyes, or a man with three goat heads. Several temples dedicated to Triglav existed near present-day Szczecin, Poland. During the period of Christianization, these temples and statues of Triglav were completely destroyed.
According to the writing of Ebbo, Triglav's heads were believed to represent sky, earth and the underworld. It was believed that Triglav has three heads because he ruled these three kingdoms and had a golden binding over his eyes and lips so he could not see people's sins nor speak about them.
