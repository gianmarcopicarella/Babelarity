The Sarthe is a river in western France. Together with the river Mayenne it forms the river Maine, which is a tributary to the river Loire.
Its source is in the Orne département, near Moulins-la-Marche. It flows generally southwest, through the following départements and towns:
Orne: Le Mêle-sur-Sarthe, Alençon
Sarthe: Fresnay-sur-Sarthe, Beaumont-sur-Sarthe, Le Mans, Sablé-sur-Sarthe
Maine-et-Loire: Châteauneuf-sur-Sarthe, Tiercé, Angers
A few kilometres after its confluence with the river Loir, it joins the Mayenne, north of the city Angers. Its two main tributaries are the Èvre and the Huisne.
