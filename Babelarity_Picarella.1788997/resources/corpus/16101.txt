Felipe Augusto Santana (Brazilian Portuguese: [fɪˈɫipɪ awˈɡuʃ.tu ˈsan.ta.ɲa], European Portuguese: [fɨˈɫip(ɨ) awˈɡuʃ.tu ˈsan.ta.na]; born 17 March 1986) is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a centre back.
Santana started his football career at Figueirense, having join the club since 1996 and then signed his professional contract in 2006. Felipe made his debut for the club, on 3 May 2007, in a 6-3 loss against Atlético Paranaense. On 4 July 2007, Santana scored his first goal of his professional career, in a 2-1 win over Cruzeiro; then, scored again two weeks later, on 14 July 2007, in a 2-1 win over Paraná. Then, in his first season, Santana made thirty-four appearance and scoring three times.
In 2008, on the opening game of the season, Santana made his last appearance, scoring a brace, in a 5-5 draw against Portuguesa.
On 16 May 2008, Santana joined Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund, with a fee in the region of €2 million (£1.6million) and signed a five-year deal. Santana had to wait for his debut until 21 September 2008, scoring his first goal in a 4-1 loss against Hoffenheim and scoring his second in the next game, in a 3-0 win over Stuttgart.
In 2009-10, 2010–11 and 2011–12 season, Santana's playing time was reduced, due to the defensive partnership with Mats Hummels and Neven Subotić and in the 2010-11 and 2011-12 seasons, the club won three domestic trophies: two times in the league in 2010–11 and 2011–12 season; another one in the DFB-Pokal, 2011–12 season. A lack of first team opportunities lead to the expectation that Santana would leave the club, a suggestion that was denied by the club's General manager Michael Zorc. At the end of the 2011-12 Bundesliga season, Santana had his contract extended until 2014.
Due to both Mats Hummels and Neven Subotić being injured in the 2012–13 Bundesliga season, Santana had more playtime that season. On 3 March 2013, Santana scored the first goal in a 3–0 victory over Shakhtar Donetsk in the UEFA Champions League with a header directly from a corner. He also scored a goal in the last minute against Málaga on 9 April 2013 to win the tie with Borussia Dortmund progressing to the semi-finals. They went on to reach the final of the UEFA Champions League, but lost 2-1. After the match, Santana said the club shouldn't have been disappointed with their progression, and stated his desire to leave the club in order to find more playing time. 
Since leaving Borussia Dortmund, Santana has been critical of Jürgen Klopp, describing him as "stupid". In response, the club's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke expressed anger towards him, calling him unprofessional. Despite being critical towards Klopp, Santana described leaving Dortmund for Schalke as a "hard decision" , due to the Revierderby between two clubs.
On 28 May 2013, FC Schalke 04 confirmed that Felipe Santana had signed a contract with them until 30 June 2016. The transfer fee was reported by media as €1,000,000 at the time. He was assigned a number 5 shirt, previously worn by Marcelo Bordon.
On 30 January 2015, he left club and was signed by Olympiacos on loan for half year.
He stated the main reason for his transfer was to play for the Brazil national football team in the 2014 World Cup.
On 11 January 2016 Santana signed a contract with the Russian Premier League side FC Kuban Krasnodar. The contract will expire in the summer of 2018.
Santana is a high-jumper, a fast-sprinter, and a hysterically strong man. Santana was described in his early 20s by Brazilian experts as a "rising star". His defensive skills and his understanding of the game on the football pitch led to comparisons with defenders Lilian Thuram, Lúcio, and Naldo.
