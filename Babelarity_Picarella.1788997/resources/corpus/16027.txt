Felipe Dias da Silva dal Belo commonly known as just Felipe (born 31 July 1984) is a Brazilian footballer who plays as a defender for Italian club Udinese. He has spent his entire professional career in Serie A.
Felipe began his career with Udinese Calcio, where he made his first team debut in April 2003. He has proven himself as a reliable central defender in Serie A, especially in the 2005–06 season for the club in the UEFA Champions League.
Felipe signed a new four-year contract with Udinese in March 2008 which would see him stay until 2012. He also signed an improved contract in November 2005.
In the 2006–07 season, Felipe missed the rest of the season after he was injured in January. He returned to the team in September 2007 and became one of the key players who helped Udinese qualify for the 2008–09 UEFA Cup. But another injury in March 2008 meant he would miss the rest of the season and he returned in November 2008. He played 6 matches in 2008–09 UEFA Cup, which he missed the front part of the tournament.
In the 2009–10 season, Felipe was not a regular; the coach preferred Andrea Coda and Christian Zapata (who changed his role from fullback) as the central defensive pair. He only played 3 league matches.
A week before the opening of the transfer window, Felipe was allowed to train with ACF Fiorentina and have medical and aptitudinal tests to finalize a possible transfer on 28 December 2009. 
On 2 January 2010, Felipe completed the transfer, signed a loan contract with option to purchase. The loan fee was €3 million. He made his debut for the Viola in a 5–1 away win to Siena. In June 2010 la Viola excised the rights to sign him for €6 million. After a disappointing performance, he was loaned out to Cesena on 31 January 2011. On 21 August 2012 he was signed by Siena.
After being released from Parma, Felipe joined Internazionale on 26 February 2015, on a six-month deal, he will wear shirt no 26.
