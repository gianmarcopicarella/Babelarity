Malher Tressor Moreno Baldrich (born January 11, 1979) is a Colombian football player who currently plays for Club Celaya.
Tressor Moreno began his career in the youth ranks of Colombia's Tuluá. In 1999 he emigrated to Peru and made his professional debut with Peruvian power Alianza Lima. While with Lima he appeared in 40 league matches and scored 16 goals, forming a formidable front line with Claudio Pizzaro. During his time with Alianza Moreno was regarded as one of the best foreign players to have played in Peru. The following season he returned to Colombia with Atlético Nacional and had another productive season appearing in 34 league matches and scoring 11 times and helping Nacional to capture the 2000 Copa Merconorte. As a result of his play with Nacional, Moreno began to draw interest from European clubs and in 2000 was sold to FC Metz in France.
In 2002 Moreno returned to Colombia as Metz loaned him to América de Cali. While with America, Tressor helped his club to the 2002 Apertura title. For the 2002 Finalización season Moreno was loaned to Independiente Medellín and helped his new club capture the Finalización title. Moreno returned to France for the 2003-04 season, and although he did not have much success with Metz he did help the club avoid relegation. Once his contract with Metz ended he returned to Colombia and played for Deportivo Cali and Once Caldas for the next few seasons.
In 2005 he would embark on a very productive career in Mexico joining Club Necaxa. He was one of Necaxa's star players during the 05/06 season appearing in 29 matches and scoring 5 goals.

While with San Luis, Moreno appeared in 89 league matches and scored 16 goals. In January 2010 Chacarita Juniors was close to signing the Colombian attacking midfielder on loan from San Luis FC, but the move finally did not materialize and Moreno joined Independiente Medellín.
