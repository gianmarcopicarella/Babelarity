Jeff Berlin (born January 17, 1953 in Queens, New York) is an American jazz fusion electric bass player, best known for playing and recording with Bill Bruford's band in the late 1970s.
Jeff Berlin originally played violin for 10 years, but seeing The Beatles inspired him to play bass. He then attended Berklee College of Music to study bass.
On August 30 2013, he married Gabriela Sinagra, an Argentine jazz singer and vocal coach from the city of Rosario.
In a review for his album Low Standards, Bass Musician Magazine says "Anytime I mention [Jeff Berlin], there seems to be a ripple in the force and the wave of Berlin supporters or antagonists come to the surface and spout-off their opinions. No matter where you stand regarding Jeffâ€™s musical philosophy, no one can reasonably deny the simple fact that Jeff seriously knows his craft and is one of the major players of our time."
Berlin's playing style has been compared to that of Jaco Pastorius, however Berlin has repeatedly stated his distaste for Jaco-imitators.
