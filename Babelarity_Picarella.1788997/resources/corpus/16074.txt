The Nigeria Premier League is the highest level of domestic Nigerian football. It is fed into by the Nigeria National League (NNL). It is organized by the League Management Company.
On May 2013, Lagosian telecommunications company Globacom signed a three-year contract with the league to become its title sponsor. Thus the league is now officially known as the Glo Premier League. In 2012 the NPL was ranked as the best in Africa and 24th best in the world by the IFFHS, the rating puts it a spot above the Scottish Premier League for the year.
The league was founded in 1972 with six teams. On 12 May 1990 at the Onikan Stadium Lagos, the league was rechristened the "Professional League" with a goal to modernize the game and make clubs self-sufficient.
From 1999–2007, there was an end of season Championship called the "Super Four". The top four teams would play a round-robin mini-league at a neutral site to determine the league champion. The Super Four is now a pre-season tournament featuring the top four teams of the prior year.
After the 2006 competition, the league changed its calendar to more closely match the common European regular season structure (starting around August and ending around May).
The League Management Company was formed in 2012 following the collapse of the Nigeria Premier League organized by the Nigeria Football League (NFL). The Nigerian Football Association, owner of the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) issued the League Management Company the license to organize and regulate the top tier league to meet global technical and commercial standards.
The League Management Company instituted match indemnities for match officials, sanctions on clubs who fail to pay salaries and allowances to their players.
In 2015, the League Management Company solicited financial support from the Government financially in order to "upgrade of existing grounds and provision of required broadcast equipment and facilities in the stadiums”.
