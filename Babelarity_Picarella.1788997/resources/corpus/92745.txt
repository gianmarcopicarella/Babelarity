Nusplingen is a Swabian town in the Zollernalb district, Baden-Württemberg, Germany.
The town is located in the valley of the small river Bära, about 12 miles up-river from where it flows into the Danube. In the Middle Ages Nusplingen gained the rights of a city. The town today has only a population of a few thousand people, but the big open market square is still to be seen in the town center in front of the town hall.
