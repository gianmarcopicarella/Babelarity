1459 Magnya (1937 VA) is a main-belt asteroid discovered on November 4, 1937, by Russian astronomer Grigory Neujmin at Simeiz Observatory. The spectrum of this object show that it has a basaltic surface, which may indicate that it is a remnant from a larger parent body that underwent differentiation prior to breaking up. As of 2000, it is the only known basalt asteroid orbiting beyond 4 Vesta.
