Elias I (also Hélie or Élie) (died 11 July 1110), called de la Flèche or de Baugency, was the Count of Maine, succeeding his cousin Hugh V, Count of Maine.
He was the son of Jean de la Flèche and Paula, daughter of Herbert I, Count of Maine.
In 1092, his cousin Hugh V sold Maine to him for 10,000 shillings. With the support of Fulk IV of Anjou, he continued the war with Robert II of Normandy. After Robert's departure with the First Crusade, Elias made peace with William Rufus, Robert's regent in Normandy.
In 1090 Elias married Matilda, daughter of Gervais II, Lord of Château-du-Loir. They had a daughter:
Ermengarde, married Fulk V of Anjou.
In 1109, says Orderic Vitalis, Elias remarried to Agnes, the daughter of William of Poitou and relict of Alfonso VI of Castile. She died the following year, however.
Elias of Maine died on July 11, 1110 and was buried in the choir of the abbey church Notre Dame de la Couture in Le Mans.
