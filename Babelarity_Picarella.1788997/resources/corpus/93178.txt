The genus Tyrannus is a group of large insect-eating birds in the tyrant flycatcher family Tyrannidae. The majority are named as kingbirds.
They prefer semi-open or open areas. These birds wait on an exposed perch and then catch insects in flight. They have long pointed wings and large broad bills.
These birds tend to defend their breeding territories aggressively, often chasing away much larger birds. The genus name means "tyrant".
