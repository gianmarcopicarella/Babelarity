Ioannis Bourousis (Greek: Ιωάννης Μπουρούσης; born November 17, 1983) is a Greek professional basketball player for Panathinaikos of the Greek Basket League and the Euroleague. He is a 7 ft 0¾ in (2.15 m) tall center. A two-time All-Euroleague First Team selection (2009, 2016), Bourousis has been compared to FIBA Hall of Fame center Vlade Divac by San Antonio Spurs' head coach Gregg Popovich.
Bourousis originally began his athletic career training to be a professional swimmer, but he grew too tall for the sport and instead took up playing basketball, at the age of 18. He began his professional career in the year 2001 with AEK Athens of the Greek Basket League. In 2006, he transferred to FC Barcelona of the Spanish ACB League. Later that same year, he joined the Greek Euroleague club Olympiacos.
In 2009, he was offered a 3-year $12 million contract by the NBA club the San Antonio Spurs. However, he turned down San Antonio's offer, and instead signed a 3-year contract extension with Olympiacos worth €5.1 million euros net income. The contract contained a €1 million euros buyout amount, which could only be used to sign with an NBA team. After 5 years with Olympiacos, the club decided to terminate his contract.
In the summer of 2011, just weeks before signing with Olimpia Milano, Bourousis was involved in a doping-related media controversy in Greece, after an unrelated football match-fixing probe of his (then future) father-in-law, Makis Psomiadis. However, Bourousis was quickly cleared of any suspected wrongdoing, after he submitted to drug testing for FIBA protocols, which are overseen by the World Anti-Doping Agency, in order to be cleared to play with Greece's national team at FIBA EuroBasket 2011.
On July 6, 2011, Bourousis then agreed to a two-year contract with the Italian A League club Olimpia Milano. In July 2013, Bourousis signed a contract with the Spanish League club Real Madrid. With Real Madrid, Bourousis won the Spanish Supercup in 2013 and the Spanish King's Cup 2014. In the summer of 2014, Real Madrid picked team option to keep him in the club for one more season.
In the 2014–15 season, Bourousis won the Euroleague 2014–15 season championship, after his team Real Madrid, defeated his former team, Olympiacos, by a score of 78–59 at the 2015 Euroleague Final Four. Real Madrid also eventually finished the season winning the 2014–15 Spanish League championship, after a 3–0 series score in the ACB Finals against Barcelona. With that trophy, they won the triple crown.
In September 2015, Bourousis signed a contract with the Spanish team Laboral Kutxa Baskonia. On December 30, 2015, he was named Player of the Month after being three times MVP of the week in the first half of the 2015–16 ACB season. He repeated again as Player of the Month in January 2016, after averaging 18.5 points per game and 7 rebounds per game, including 24 points scored in the win against Real Madrid. On May 23, 2016, he was named Most Valuable Player Award of the 2015–16 season after averaging 12.9 points per game, 7.1 rebounds per game, 2.2 assists per game and 0.9 steals per game.
On July 12, 2016, Bourousis signed with Panathinaikos.
Bourousis was a member of the junior Greek national basketball team that won the 2002 FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship in Lithuania. He was on the men's Greek national basketball team that won the EuroBasket 2005 in Serbia, and played an instrumental role as Greece won the bronze medal at the EuroBasket 2009. He was also a member of the Greek national teams that finished fourth in the EuroBasket 2007, and fifth in the 2008 Summer Olympic Games.
During an international friendly game between the national teams of Greece and Serbia, during the 2010 Acropolis Tournament, the Serbian player, Nenad Krstić, hit Bourousis on the head with a chair. "I thought he was a fan attacking me", Krstić declared the next day. Bourousis first pressed charges against Krstić and decided to sue, but he quickly changed his mind and dropped them.
Bourousis was also a member of the Greek national teams that competed at the 2010 FIBA World Championship and the EuroBasket 2011. He also played at the 2012 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament, the EuroBasket 2013, the 2014 FIBA World Cup, and the EuroBasket 2015.
