Antonio 'Totò' Di Natale (Italian pronunciation: [anˈtɔnjo di naˈtale]; born 13 October 1977) is an Italian footballer who last played as a forward for Italian club Udinese in 2016.
After being a member of the Empoli youth side since 1994, Di Natale started his professional career with the Empoli senior side in 1996, and remained with the club until 2004, aside from brief loan spells with Iperzola, Varese, and Viareggio. During his time with Empoli, he helped the club to achieve Serie A promotion during the 2001–02 Serie B season, scoring 16 goals. His breakthrough subsequently came during the 2002–03 Serie A season, as he scored 13 goals in the league and helped Empoli avoid relegation; despite being unable to find the net as regularly or save Empoli from relegation the following season, his performances and consistent goalscoring earned him a transfer to Udinese in 2004.
During his time with Udinese, Di Natale's skill and ability to both score and create many goals played a key role in helping the club to third and fourth-place finishes in Serie A, and achieve UEFA Champions League qualification. Di Natale's consistent goalscoring with Udinese saw him reach double figures for nine consecutive league seasons; he won the Serie A top goalscorer award in 2010 and 2011, and was also awarded the Serie A Italian Footballer of the Year award for his performances in 2010. Unlike most strikers, he enjoyed his most prolific seasons in front of goal well after the age of 30; between 2009 and 2011, Lionel Messi (82) and Cristiano Ronaldo (86) were the only two players to have scored more goals than Di Natale (67). In 2015, France Football rated him as one of the 10 best footballers in the world who are over the age of 36.
Di Natale is Udinese's top appearance holder and goal-scorer in Serie A, with 191 goals in 385 appearances, and in UEFA club competitions, with 17 goals in 37 appearances. With 209 goals, he is also the 6th highest goal-scorer in Serie A, and with 311 goals, he is the 8th highest scoring Italian player in all competitions, behind Silvio Piola, Alessandro Del Piero, Giuseppe Meazza, Roberto Baggio, Filippo Inzaghi, Francesco Totti, and Luca Toni.
At international level, Di Natale has also represented the Italy national football team 42 times, scoring 11 goals. With Italy, he took part at UEFA Euro 2008, the 2010 FIFA World Cup, scoring a goal, and at UEFA Euro 2012, where he also scored a goal as Italy reached the final of the tournament.
Also known as Totò, Di Natale was born in Naples on 13 October 1977 to Salvatore, a professional painter, and Giovanna. He has two brothers, Paolo and Carmine, and two sisters, Michela and Anna.
Despite being born in Naples, Antonio Di Natale made the move north for his footballing career, joining Empoli's youth system. While at Empoli, he was loaned out three times, enjoying success with Viareggio in the 1998–99 campaign, where he scored 12 goals in 25 games for the Tuscan side. Upon his return to his parent club, Di Natale finally made his breakthrough into the first team squad and established himself as an integral member of the side. He netted six times in 25 appearances for Empoli during the 1999–2000 campaign, as Empoli finished in ninth place in Serie B.
Empoli won promotion to the Serie A in 2002 after finishing in fourth place during the 2001–02 Serie B season with 67 points. They finished with 60 goals, the largest tally in the competition, and Di Natale finished as the club's top goalscorer with 16 league goals. In Empoli's first season back in the topflight, Di Natale helped the club fight off relegation by netting 13 times in the league. This included a hat-trick in Empoli's 4–2 defeat of Reggina on 17 November 2002. The next season was less fortunate for Di Natale, who only scored five goals in the league. Following two seasons in the Serie A, Empoli were relegated back to the Serie B at the end of the 2003–04 campaign.
After Empoli were relegated, Di Natale joined Udinese for the 2004–05 Serie A season, along with Manuel Belleri and Emílson Cribari. In Udine, Di Natale partnered with Vincenzo Iaquinta and David Di Michele in attack, and the Friulian club finished fourth place at the end of the season and qualified for the Champions League for the following year. In his debut season with Udinese, Di Natale played 33 games and scored seven goals.
He scored a lob in the fifth minute and a volley in the 63rd with his "weaker" left foot. Forming a formidable attacking duo with Fabio Quagliarella, Di Natale improved his goal tally, becoming the focal point of the attack. In 2007, he was named captain of Udinese and his contract was extended to 30 June 2012.
May 2010 saw the conclusion of Di Natale's best-ever season, scoring 29 goals in Serie A, and contributing 54% of Udinese's total goals. He also surpassed Oliver Bierhoff's club record for most league goals in a season, who had scored 28. A brace against Bari on 9 May 2010 saw Di Natale surpass the 100 goal mark in Serie A. For his performances, Di Natale was voted Serie A Italian Footballer of the Year and finished as the top scorer in Serie A. He also received the Serie A Fair Play award for interrupting play in a match while Lazio's Libor Kozák was injured, with Udinese down 3–2 late in the game. The 2009–10 season saw Di Natale finish as runner-up for the European Golden Shoe with Chelsea striker Didier Drogba on 29 goals, five behind FC Barcelona forward Lionel Messi. He also helped the club to reach the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia that season.
On 14 November 2010, Di Natale scored a hat-trick during a match against Lecce and on 28 November, he scored a second consecutive home hat-trick during a match against hometown club Napoli. On 8 May 2011, Di Natale struck two first half goals to give Udinese a 2–1 victory over Lazio and into fourth place with two games remaining to play. Despite Di Natale missing a late penalty, with a 0–0 draw against champions Milan on the final day, Udinese secured fourth place and a spot in the playoff round of the Champions League. During the 2010–11 season, Di Natale had the best strike rate of any player in Italy, scoring 28 goals in 36 games with a strike rate of 0.78 goals per game. This was also the third best strike rate in Europe, behind Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo and Barcelona's Lionel Messi.
On 23 October 2011, Di Natale netted a brace in a 3–0 defeat of Novara, which sent Udinese to the top of the Serie A standings. On 13 May 2012, Di Natale opened the scoring against Catania on the final matchday of the Serie A season and Diego Fabbrini added a second-half strike to secure four straight Serie A victories and ensure Udinese a place in next season's Champions League qualifying round. On 4 July 2012 he signed a new 2-year contract with the club.
Di Natale's first goal of the 2012–13 season came on 16 September 2012 when he scored Udinese's second goal within five minutes of the start of the game, but a red card to Andrea Lazzari and two lates goals from Siena condemned Udinese to a 2–2 draw. On 6 January 2013, Di Natale notched a brace as Udinese downed 10-man Internazionale 3–0, lifting Udinese to eighth in the table. In Udinese's next league match, on 13 January, Di Natale scored two more goals as his side defeated Fiorentina 3–1 to extend their streak of five unbeaten Serie A matches. Di Natale scored his 150th Serie A goal for Udinese on 3 March, converting from close range after a cross from Luis Muriel, securing a 0–1 victory at Pescara.
His last goal of the 2012–13 campaign came on the final matchday, on 19 May 2013, scoring Udinese's winning goal in a 5–2 thrashing of Internazionale, confirming the club's place in the UEFA Europa League for the following season.
Before the 2013–14 season Di Natale was offered a contract with an annual salary of €10 million by Chinese club Guangzhou Evergrande, which was coached by his former Italy manager Marcello Lippi at the time; however, he declined the offer and chose to stay with Udinese. After Udinese's 3–1 loss to Hellas Verona on January 6, 2014, Di Natale told Sky Sports Italia he would retire at the end of the 2013–14 season. "I have already decided, in June I'll stop playing football. It's already established."
On 8 March 2014, Di Natale scored his 185th Serie A goal, the winning strike in Udinese's 1–0 victory over Milan, to overtake Gabriel Batistuta on the all-time Serie A scoring charts. He ended the 2013–14 season with 17 goals, making him the fourth-top goalscorer in Serie A at the age of 36. Despite previously announcing he would retire from professional football at the end of the 2013–14 Serie A season, Di Natale confirmed on 30 May 2014 that he had decided he would not retire, and would continue to play on into the 2014–15 season.
Di Natale scored four goals in a 5–1 win over Ternana in the third round of the Coppa Italia on 23 August 2014. On the 31 August in Udinese's opening Serie A match of the 2014–15 season, Di Natale scored two second half goals in a home win over newly promoted Empoli. On 23 November 2014, Di Natale scored his 200th goal in his 400th appearance in Serie A.
On February 2, 2015, Di Natale was offered an $8 million contract by a yet unnamed team in the MLS. Di Natale has been linked to MLS expansion club New York City FC. On 28 April, Di Natale scored his 205th goal in Serie A, matching Italian legend Roberto Baggio as the sixth highest goalscorer in Serie A history, at the age of 37; this was also his 700th career appearance. The following matchday, on 3 May, Di Natale scored in a 1–0 victory over Verona, overtaking Baggio with his 206th goal in Serie A. On 12 May, Di Natale once again took back his decision to retire at the end of the 2014–15 season, stating that he intended to play for another season. In late April 2016, Di Natale stated that he would leave the club at the end of the 2015–16 season, although he also added that he intended to continue playing professional football. On 15 May 2016, Di Natale scored a goal from the penalty spot in a 2–1 home defeat to Carpi in his final appearance with Udinese, scoring a total of 191 goals in 385 league appearances during his 12 years with the club, and 227 goals for the club in all competitions.
Di Natale made his debut with the Italian national team on 20 November 2002, under manager Giovanni Trapattoni, in a friendly match against Turkey. He won few caps in later years, scoring his first goal on 18 February 2004 in a friendly match against the Czech Republic, a game which ended in a 2–2 draw.
In 2006, Di Natale regained a spot with the Azzurri under new coach Roberto Donadoni and was involved in the Euro 2008 qualification campaign. He was then called up to UEFA Euro 2008, where he missed a crucial penalty during the quarter-final penalty shoot-out against Spain, who went on to win 4–2 on penalties and later the entire tournament. He missed the 2009 Confederations Cup because of a knee injury, which occurred on 28 March 2009 in an international match against Montenegro.
Di Natale took part at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, under manager Marcello Lippi, where he was given the iconic number 10 shirt. Italy was placed into Group F at the finals, drawing their first two group games by a score of 1–1 to Paraguay and New Zealand, respectively. In their final group game on 24 June 2010, he scored a goal in the 3–2 defeat against Slovakia, which resulted in Italy finishing bottom of its group.
In 2012, Di Natale was included in the Italy squad for UEFA Euro 2012, under manager Cesare Prandelli, making 5 appearances throughout the tournament, appearing in every match except for the quarter-final against England. After coming on as a substitute in the first match against defending champions Spain, on 10 June 2012, he scored the opening goal in a 1–1 draw, curling a right-footed shot past goalkeeper Iker Casillas, after receiving a through-ball from Andrea Pirlo; this was the only goal that Spain conceded throughout the entire tournament. Italy eventually reached the final of the tournament, which was played on 1 July 2012, at the Olympic Stadium in Kiev. The Italians suffered a 4–0 defeat to Spain, with Di Natale making a substitute appearance during the match.
Following the tournament, Di Natale retired from international football with 11 goals scored from 42 games for the Azzurri.
A quick, mobile, hardworking, and versatile striker, with a lethal eye for goal, Di Natale can play anywhere along the front line; he has been deployed as a lone striker, out wide in an attacking trident, or even in a deeper, creative, supporting role. He is known for his control, technical skills, and for his ability to both score and create goals. Regarded as one of the best Italian forwards of his generation, Di Natale earned the prestigious Serie A Capocannoniere award — as Serie A's top goalscorer — for the 2009–10 and 2010–11 seasons, also winning the AIC Serie A Italian Footballer of the Year award in 2010.
While playing for Empoli, at the age of 19, Di Natale met his future wife, Ilenia Betti, whom he married on 15 June 2002; the couple have two sons together, Filippo and Diletta. In August 2010, he rejected a transfer to Italian giants Juventus because his children had grown up in Udine and his family was settled and enjoyed living there.
Di Natale took financial responsibility of the disabled sister of Udinese teammate Piermario Morosini, who died on 14 April 2012 when he suffered sudden cardiac arrest while playing on loan for Livorno. Morosini's death left his sister with no other living relatives.
