The flag of Tuva, a republic in the Russian Federation, is a light blue field with a white-fimbriated pall of the same color bordering a yellow triangle on the hoist.
White symbolizes silver and virtue; additionally, it is common in Tuva for hostesses to greet guests with silver streamers in their arms. The yellow triangle symbolizes gold and Buddhism. Blue symbolizes the morals of nomadic herdsmen (who are commonly respected in the region), as well the Tuvan sky. The blue pall symbolizes the confluence of the Bii-Khem (Bolshoy Yenisei) and Kaa-Khem (Maly Yenisei) rivers at the Tuvan capital of Qızıl, where they form the Yenisei River, known to locals as the Ulug-Khem River.
The flag was created on September 18, 1992 by Oyun-ool Sat, I. C. Salchak and O. I. Lazarev. The proportions are 2:3.
