Raven Software (or Raven Entertainment Software, Inc.) is an American video game developing company based in Wisconsin and founded in 1990. In 1997, Raven made an exclusive publishing deal with Activision and was subsequently acquired by them. After the acquisition, many of the studio's original developers, largely responsible for creating the Heretic and Hexen: Beyond Heretic games, left to form Human Head Studios.
Raven Software was founded in 1990 by brothers Brian and Steve Raffel. The company was independent until 1997 when it was acquired by Activision.
Raven has a history of working with id Software, who were briefly located on the same street. They used id's engines for many of their games, such as Heretic in 1994. They took over development of id's Quake franchise for Quake 4 and the 2009 iteration of id's Wolfenstein series.
The company started with three development teams. In August 2009 following poor performance and possible over-budget of Wolfenstein, the company made a major layoff of 30-35 staff, leaving two development teams. This was reduced to one after more layoffs in October 2010, after delays with Singularity; as many as 40 staff were released. Following the layoffs, Raven has focused on assisting with the Call of Duty series.
In 2012, Raven began hiring employees for a next generation game, and were announced as collaborating with Infinity Ward on Call of Duty: Ghosts in May 2013.
On 3 April 2013 following the closure of LucasArts, Raven Software released the source code for Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast and Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy on Sourceforge.
As of April 2014, the company is the lead developer of the free-to-play Chinese Call of Duty title, Call of Duty: Online. The company is also remastering Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare.
