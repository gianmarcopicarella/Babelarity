"Decode" is a song by American rock band Paramore. The song was released as a single in 2008 from the soundtrack of the film Twilight. It is also included as a bonus track on the international version of Paramore's third studio album, Brand New Eyes.
An acoustic version of this song was released as a part of the special CD/DVD of the Twilight soundtrack. The song was certified Platinum in the U.S on February 16, 2010, selling over 1,000,000 copies. It was also nominated for a Grammy Award in 2010 for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media.
Hayley Williams from Paramore is a Twilight fan and has talked about her love of the books and the song's title:
Alexandra Cahill of Billboard gave the song a positive review by stating that "vocalist Hayley Williams captures the tension and urgency between undead protagonist Edward and mortal love interest Bella with an impassioned, yet restrained performance". Cahill also stated, "expertly crafted follow-up Decode promises to stake a claim at modern rock and top 40 radio".
Entertainment Weekly said that "Decode" took a step away from Paramore's "bouncier punk-pop sound for a more sprawling, Evanescence-like romanticism".
