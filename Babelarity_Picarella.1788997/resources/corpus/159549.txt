New Madrid (pronounced /njuː ˈmædrᵻd/ new-MAD-rid) is a city in New Madrid County, Missouri, United States. Located on the Kentucky Bend of the Mississippi River, it is 42 miles (68 km) south by west of Cairo, Illinois, and north of an exclave of Fulton County, Kentucky, across the river.
New Madrid was founded between 1777 and 1778 by Spanish Governor Bernardo de Gálvez who controlled Spanish Louisiana (the land west of the Mississippi River). He welcomed settlers from the United States, but required them to become citizens of Spain. In addition, they had to agree to live under the guidance of his appointed empresario, Colonel William Morgan, a Revolutionary War veteran from New Jersey. Morgan recruited a number of American families to settle at New Madrid, attracting some 2,000 persons to the region. In 1800, Spain traded the territory to France in the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso. France promptly sold it to the United States in 1803 as part of the Louisiana Purchase.
The settlement is located on the north side of the Kentucky Bend in the Mississippi River, which is also known as "New Madrid Bend" or "Madrid Bend." The river curves in an oxbow around an exclave of Fulton County, Kentucky. Scientists expect the river eventually to cut across the neck of the peninsula and make a more direct channel.
The city is remembered as being near the Mississippi River military engagement, the Battle of Island Number Ten, during the Civil War.
This floodplain area was cultivated as cotton plantations. At the turn of the 20th century, New Madrid contained two lumber mills, a grist mill, a stave and heading factory, and a cotton gin; and four Protestant churches, two with African-American congregations, and one Catholic church. In 1900, 1,489 people lived in New Madrid, Missouri; in 1910, the population was 1,882.
