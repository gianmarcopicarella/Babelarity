Molality, also called molal concentration, is a measure of the concentration of a solute in a solution in terms of amount of substance in a specified amount of mass of the solvent. This contrasts with the definition of molarity which is based on a specified volume of solution.
A commonly used unit for molality in chemistry is mol/kg. A solution of concentration 1 mol/kg is also sometimes denoted as 1 molal.
The molality (b), of a solution is defined as the amount of substance (in moles) of solute, nsolute, divided by the mass (in kg) of the solvent, msolvent:
        b
        =
              n
                  s
                  o
                  l
                  u
                  t
                  e
              m
                  s
                  o
                  l
                  v
                  e
                  n
                  t
    {\displaystyle b={\frac {n_{\mathrm {solute} }}{m_{\mathrm {solvent} }}}}
The term molality is formed in analogy to molarity which is the molar concentration of a solution. The earliest known use of the intensive property molality and of its adjectival unit, the now-deprecated molal, appears to have been published by G. N. Lewis and M. Randall in the 1923 publication of Thermodynamics and the Free Energies of Chemical Substances. Though the two terms are subject to being confused with one another, the molality and molarity of a weak aqueous solution are nearly the same, as one kilogram of water (solvent) occupies the volume of 1 liter at room temperature and a small amount of solute has little effect on the volume.
The SI unit for molality is moles per kilogram.
A solution with a molality of 3 mol/kg is often described as "3 molal" or "3 m". However, following the SI system of units, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the United States authority on measurement, considers the term "molal" and the unit symbol "m" to be obsolete, and suggests mol/kg or a related unit of the SI. This recommendation has not been universally implemented in academia yet.
Advantages
The primary advantage of using molality as a measure of concentration is that molality only depends on the masses of solute and solvent, which are unaffected by variations in temperature and pressure. In contrast, solutions prepared volumetrically (e.g. molar concentration or mass concentration) are likely to change as temperature and pressure change. In many applications, this is a significant advantage because the mass, or the amount, of a substance is often more important than its volume (e.g. in a limiting reagent problem).
Another advantage of molality is the fact that the molality of one solute in a solution is independent of the presence or absence of other solutes.
Problem areas
Unlike all the other compositional properties listed in "Relation" section (below), molality depends on the choice of the substance to be called “solvent” in an arbitrary mixture. If there is only one pure liquid substance in a mixture, the choice is clear, but not all solutions are this clear-cut: in an alcohol-water solution, either one could be called the solvent; in an alloy, or solid solution, there is no clear choice and all constituents may be treated alike. In such situations, mass or mole fraction is the preferred compositional specification.
In what follows, the solvent may be given the same treatment as the other constituents of the solution, such that the molality of the solvent of an n-solute solution, say b0, is found to be nothing more than the reciprocal of its molar mass, M0:
          b
            0
        =
              n
                0

First derive the molality of the solvent, in mol/kg,

    {\displaystyle b_{\mathrm {H_{2}O} }={\frac {1}{M_{\mathrm {H_{2}O} }}}={\frac {1}{0.018}}\ \mathrm {mol/kg} ,}
and use that to derive all the others by use of the equal ratios:

                  N

                        3
        ∴

    {\displaystyle {\frac {b_{\mathrm {HNO_{3}} }}{b_{\mathrm {H_{2}O} }}}={\frac {w_{\mathrm {HNO_{3}} }M_{\mathrm {H_{2}O} }}{w_{\mathrm {H_{2}O} }M_{\mathrm {HNO_{3}} }}}\quad \therefore b_{\mathrm {HNO_{3}} }=18.83\ \mathrm {mol/kg} .}
Actually, bH2O cancels out, because it is not needed. In this case, there is a more direct equation: we use it to derive the molality of HF:
          b
              H
              F
        =
              w

                  F
                w

                        2

                M
                    H
                    F
        =

          k
          g
        .
    {\displaystyle b_{\mathrm {HF} }={\frac {w_{\mathrm {HF} }}{w_{\mathrm {H_{2}O} }M_{\mathrm {HF} }}}=2.19\ \mathrm {mol/kg} .}
The mole fractions may be derived from this result:

Osmolality is a variation of molality that takes into account only solutes that contribute to a solution's osmotic pressure. It is measured in osmoles of the solute per kilogram of water. This unit is frequently used in medical laboratory results in place of osmolarity, because it can be measured simply by depression of the freezing point of a solution, or cryoscopy (see also: osmostat and colligative properties).
Molality appears in the expression of the apparent (molar) volume of a solute as a function of the molality b of that solute (and density of the solution and solvent):
            ϕ
                V

    {\displaystyle {}^{\phi }{\tilde {V}}_{1}={\frac {1}{b}}\left({\frac {1}{\rho }}-{\frac {1}{\rho _{0}^{0}}}\right)+{\frac {M_{1}}{\rho }}}
For multicomponent systems the relation is slightly modified by the sum of molalities of solutes.
