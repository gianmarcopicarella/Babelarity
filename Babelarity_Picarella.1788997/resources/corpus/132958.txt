The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York is a Latin Catholic archdiocese in New York State. It encompasses the boroughs of Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island in New York City and the Counties of Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan, Ulster, and Westchester in New York. The Archdiocese of New York is the second-largest diocese in the United States, encompassing 296 parishes that serve around 2.8 million Catholics in addition to hundreds of Catholic schools, hospitals and charities. The Archdiocese also operates the well-known St. Joseph's Seminary, commonly referred to as Dunwoodie. The Archdiocese of New York is the metropolitan see of the ecclesiastical province of New York which includes the suffragan dioceses of Albany, Brooklyn, Buffalo, Ogdensburg, Rochester, Rockville Centre and Syracuse.
The Latin name of the archdiocese is Archidioecesis Neo-Eboracensis (Eboracum being the Roman name of York, England), and the corporate name is Archdiocese of New York.
It publishes a bi-weekly newspaper, Catholic New York, the largest of its kind in the United States.
The ordinary of the Archdiocese of New York is an archbishop whose cathedra is The Cathedral of St. Patrick (commonly St. Patrick's Cathedral) in Manhattan, New York. The Archbishop of New York is also the metropolitan of the larger Ecclesiastical Province of New York, which consists of the eight dioceses that comprise the State of New York with the exception of a small portion (Fishers Island) that belongs to the Province of Hartford. As such, the metropolitan archbishop possesses certain limited authority over the suffragan sees of the province (see ecclesiastical province).
R. Luke Concanen became the first Bishop of the (then) Diocese of New York in 1808. The current Archbishop of New York is Timothy Michael Cardinal Dolan.
Initially, the territory that now makes up the Archdiocese of New York was part of the Prefecture Apostolic of United States of America which was established on November 26, 1784. On November 6, 1789, the Prefecture was elevated to a diocese and the present territory of the Archdiocese of New York fell under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Baltimore, headed by the first American bishop, John Carroll.
At the time, there was a dearth of priests to minister to the large territory. The first Roman Catholic Church in New York City was St. Peter's on Barclay Street. The land was purchased from Trinity Church with community donations and a gift of 1,000 pieces of silver from King Charles III of Spain. The church was built in the federal style. Among its regular worshippers were Saint Elizabeth Seton and Venerable Pierre Toussaint.
On April 8, 1808, the Holy See raised Baltimore to the status of an Archdiocese. At the same time, the dioceses of Philadelphia, Boston, Bardstown (now Louisville, KY) and New York were created. At the time of its establishment, the Diocese of New York covered all of the State of New York, as well as the northeastern New Jersey counties of Sussex, Bergen, Morris, Essex, Somerset, Middlesex, and Monmouth.
Since the first appointed bishop could not set sail from Italy due to the Napoleonic blockade, a Jesuit priest, Anthony Kohlmann, was appointed administrator. He was instrumental in organizing the diocese and preparing for the Cathedral of St. Patrick to be built on Mulberry Street. Among the difficulties faced by Catholics at the time was anti-Catholic bigotry in general and in the New York school system. A strong Nativist movement sought to keep Catholics out of the country and to prevent those already present from advancing.
On April 23, 1847 territory was taken from the Diocese to form the Dioceses of Albany and Buffalo. The Diocese was elevated to an Archdiocese on July 19, 1850. On July 29, 1853 territory was again taken from the Diocese, this time to form the Diocese of Newark and the Diocese of Brooklyn. The Bahamas were made a part of the Archdiocese of New York, establishing the first permanent Catholic presence, on July 25, 1885 due to their proximity to New York's busy port. Churches and schools were constructed and administered until The Bahamas' eventual dissociation to form the Prefecture Apostolic of Bahama (now the Archdiocese of Nassau) on March 21, 1929. By 1932, The Bahamas were no longer under the spiritual jurisdiction of New York.
As of 2014 the Catholic population of the Archdiocese is 2,634,624. These Catholics were served by 932 archdiocesan priests and 913 priests of religious orders. Also laboring in the diocese were 359 permanent deacons, 1,493 religious brothers, and 3,153 nuns.
For comparison, in 1929, the Catholic population of the Archdiocese was 1,273,291 persons. There were 1,314 clergy ministering in the archdiocese and 444 churches. There were also 170,348 children in Catholic educational and welfare institutions.
In 1959, there were 7,913 nuns and sisters ministering in the Archdiocese, representing 103 different religious orders.
