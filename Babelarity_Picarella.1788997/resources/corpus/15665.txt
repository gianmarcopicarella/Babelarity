1. Liga Promotion is the third tier of the Swiss football league system, below the Swiss Challenge League and above the 1. Liga Classic. Introduced in 2012 the division has 16 teams.
The league was introduced at the end of the 2011–12 season and replaced the 1. Liga as the third tier of the league system, with the latter thereby moving to the fourth tier. Sixteen clubs compete in the league, playing each other twice during the seasons, once home and once away. The league champions are promoted to the second tier, the Challenge League, subject to licence regulations. The bottom two clubs of the 1. Liga Promotion are relegated to the 1. Liga with the best two clubs from this level promoted to the 1. Liga Promotion. It is the highest league level in Switzerland that permits participation of reserve teams.
