In mathematical analysis Hölder's inequality, named after Otto Hölder, is a fundamental inequality between integrals and an indispensable tool for the study of Lp spaces.
Theorem (Hölder's inequality). Let (S, Σ, μ) be a measure space and let p, q ∈ [1, ∞] with 1/p + 1/q = 1. Then, for all measurable real- or complex-valued functions f and g on S,
        ∥
        f
        g
          ∥
            1
        ≤
        ∥
        f
          ∥
            p
        ∥
        g
          ∥
            q
        .
    {\displaystyle \|fg\|_{1}\leq \|f\|_{p}\|g\|_{q}.}
If, in addition, p, q ∈ (1, ∞) and f ∈ Lp(μ) and g ∈ Lq(μ), then Hölder's inequality becomes an equality if and only if | f  |p and |g|q are linearly dependent in L1(μ), meaning that there exist real numbers α, β ≥ 0, not both of them zero, such that α|f |p = β |g|q μ-almost everywhere.
The numbers p and q above are said to be Hölder conjugates of each other. The special case p = q = 2 gives a form of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality. Hölder's inequality holds even if || fg ||1 is infinite, the right-hand side also being infinite in that case. Conversely, if f  is in Lp(μ) and g is in Lq(μ), then the pointwise product fg is in L1(μ).
Hölder's inequality is used to prove the Minkowski inequality, which is the triangle inequality in the space Lp(μ), and also to establish that Lq(μ) is the dual space of Lp(μ) for p ∈ [1, ∞).
Hölder's inequality was first found by Rogers (1888), and discovered independently by Hölder (1889).
The brief statement of Hölder's inequality uses some conventions.
In the definition of Hölder conjugates, 1/ ∞ means zero.
If p, q ∈ [1, ∞), then || f  ||p and || g ||q stand for the (possibly infinite) expressions
                    (
                      ∫
                        S

                    )

                      p
                    (
                      ∫
                        S
                      |
                    g
                        |
                        q
                      d
                    μ
                    )
                      1
                      q
    {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&\left(\int _{S}|f|^{p}\,\mathrm {d} \mu \right)^{\frac {1}{p}}\\&\left(\int _{S}|g|^{q}\,\mathrm {d} \mu \right)^{\frac {1}{q}}\end{aligned}}}
If p = ∞, then || f  ||∞ stands for the essential supremum of | f  |, similarly for || g ||∞.
The notation || f  ||p with 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ is a slight abuse, because in general it is only a norm of f  if || f  ||p is finite and f  is considered as equivalence class of μ-almost everywhere equal functions. If f ∈ Lp(μ) and g ∈ Lq(μ), then the notation is adequate.
On the right-hand side of Hölder's inequality, 0 × ∞ as well as ∞ × 0 means 0. Multiplying a > 0 with ∞ gives ∞.
As above, let f  and g denote measurable real- or complex-valued functions defined on S. If || fg ||1 is finite, then the pointwise products of f  with g and its complex conjugate function are μ-integrable, the estimate

          ∫
            S

    {\displaystyle {\biggl |}\int _{S}f{\bar {g}}\,\mathrm {d} \mu {\biggr |}\leq \int _{S}|fg|\,\mathrm {d} \mu =\|fg\|_{1}}
and the similar one for fg hold, and Hölder's inequality can be applied to the right-hand side. In particular, if f  and g are in the Hilbert space L2(μ), then Hölder's inequality for p = q = 2 implies
          |
        ⟨
        f
        ,
        g
        ⟩

            2
        ∥
        g
          ∥
            2
        ,
    {\displaystyle |\langle f,g\rangle |\leq \|f\|_{2}\|g\|_{2},}
where the angle brackets refer to the inner product of L2(μ). This is also called Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, but requires for its statement that || f  ||2 and || g ||2 are finite to make sure that the inner product of f  and g is well defined. We may recover the original inequality (for the case p = 2) by using the functions | f  | and | g | in place of f  and g.
If (S, Σ, μ) is a probability space, then p, q ∈ [1, ∞] just need to satisfy 1/p + 1/q ≤ 1, rather than being Hölder conjugates. A combination of Hölder's inequality and Jensen's inequality implies that
        ∥
        f
        g
          ∥
            1
        ≤

        g
          ∥
            q
    {\displaystyle \|fg\|_{1}\leq \|f\|_{p}\|g\|_{q}}
for all measurable real- or complex-valued functions f  and g on S.
For the following cases assume that p and q are in the open interval (1,∞) with 1/p + 1/q = 1.
For the n-dimensional Euclidean space, when the set S is {1, ..., n} with the counting measure, we have

If S = N with the counting measure, then we get Hölder's inequality for sequence spaces:

If S is a measurable subset of Rn with the Lebesgue measure, and f  and g are measurable real- or complex-valued functions on S, then Hölder inequality is

In particular, if the sth absolute moment is finite, then the r th absolute moment is finite, too. (This also follows from Jensen's inequality.)
For two σ-finite measure spaces (S1, Σ1, μ1) and (S2, Σ2, μ2) define the product measure space by

where S is the Cartesian product of S1 and S2, the σ-algebra Σ arises as product σ-algebra of Σ1 and Σ2, and μ denotes the product measure of μ1 and μ2. Then Tonelli's theorem allows us to rewrite Hölder's inequality using iterated integrals: If f  and g are Σ-measurable real- or complex-valued functions on the Cartesian product S, then

This can be generalized to more than two σ-finite measure spaces.
Let (S, Σ, μ) denote a σ-finite measure space and suppose that f = (f1, ..., fn) and g = (g1, ..., gn) are Σ-measurable functions on S, taking values in the n-dimensional real- or complex Euclidean space. By taking the product with the counting measure on {1, ..., n}, we can rewrite the above product measure version of Hölder's inequality in the form

This finite-dimensional version generalizes to functions f  and g taking values in a sequence space.
There are several proofs of Hölder's inequality; the main idea in the following is Young's inequality.
If || f  ||p = 0, then f  is zero μ-almost everywhere, and the product fg is zero μ-almost everywhere, hence the left-hand side of Hölder's inequality is zero. The same is true if || g ||q = 0. Therefore, we may assume || f  ||p > 0 and || g ||q > 0 in the following.
If || f  ||p = ∞ or || g ||q = ∞, then the right-hand side of Hölder's inequality is infinite. Therefore, we may assume that || f  ||p and || g ||q are in (0, ∞).
If p = ∞ and q = 1, then | fg | ≤ || f  ||∞ | g | almost everywhere and Hölder's inequality follows from the monotonicity of the Lebesgue integral. Similarly for p = 1 and q = ∞. Therefore, we may also assume p, q ∈ (1, ∞).
Dividing f  and g by || f  ||p and || g ||q, respectively, we can assume that
        ∥
        f
          ∥
            p
        =
        ∥
        g
          ∥
            q
        =
        1.
    {\displaystyle \|f\|_{p}=\|g\|_{q}=1.}
We now use Young's inequality, which states that
        a
        b
        ≤
              a
                p

        +
              b
                q
            q
    {\displaystyle ab\leq {\frac {a^{p}}{p}}+{\frac {b^{q}}{q}}}
for all nonnegative a and b, where equality is achieved if and only if ap = bq. Hence
          |
        f
        (
        s
        )
        g
        (
        s
        )
          |
        ≤
                |
              f
              (
              s
              )
                  |
                  p
            p
        +

              g
              (

              )

        S
        .
    {\displaystyle |f(s)g(s)|\leq {\frac {|f(s)|^{p}}{p}}+{\frac {|g(s)|^{q}}{q}},\qquad s\in S.}
Integrating both sides gives
        ∥
        f
        g
          ∥
            1

        =
        1
        ,
    {\displaystyle \|fg\|_{1}\leq {\frac {1}{p}}+{\frac {1}{q}}=1,}
which proves the claim.
Under the assumptions p ∈ (1, ∞) and || f  ||p = || g ||q, equality holds if and only if | f  |p = | g |q almost everywhere. More generally, if || f  ||p and || g ||q are in (0, ∞), then Hölder's inequality becomes an equality if and only if there exist real numbers α, β > 0, namely
        α

    {\displaystyle \alpha |f|^{p}=\beta |g|^{q}\,}
     μ-almost everywhere   (*).
The case || f  ||p = 0 corresponds to β = 0 in (*). The case || g ||q = 0 corresponds to α = 0 in (*).
Assume that 1 ≤ p < ∞ and let q denote the Hölder conjugate. Then, for every f ∈ Lp(μ),

where max indicates that there actually is a g maximizing the right-hand side. When p = ∞ and if each set A in the σ-field Σ with μ(A) = ∞ contains a subset B ∈ Σ with 0 < μ(B) < ∞ (which is true in particular when μ is σ-finite), then

The extremal equality is one of the ways for proving the triangle inequality || f1 + f2 ||p ≤ || f1 ||p + || f2 ||p for all f1 and f2 in Lp(μ), see Minkowski inequality.
Hölder's inequality implies that every f ∈ Lp(μ) defines a bounded (or continuous) linear functional κf  on Lq(μ) by the formula
          κ
            f
        (
        g

        .
    {\displaystyle \kappa _{f}(g)=\int _{S}fg\,\mathrm {d} \mu ,\qquad g\in L^{q}(\mu ).}
The extremal equality (when true) shows that the norm of this functional κf  as element of the continuous dual space Lq(μ)* coincides with the norm of f  in Lp(μ) (see also the Lp-space article).

        f
        ,
        g
        ∈
        F
        (
        S
        ,
          C
        )
    {\displaystyle f,g\in F(S,\mathbb {C} )}
   we have the following implication (the seminorm is also allowed to attain the value ∞):
        ∀
        s
        ∈
        S
        f
        (
        s
        )
        ⩾
        g
        (
        s
        )
        ⩾
        0
        ⇒
        N
        (
        f
        )
        ⩾
        N
        (
        g
        )
        .
    {\displaystyle \forall s\in S\quad f(s)\geqslant g(s)\geqslant 0\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad N(f)\geqslant N(g).}
Then:
        ∀
        f
        ,
        g
        ∈
        F
        (
        S
        ,
          C
        )
        N
        (
          |
        f
        g
          |
        )
        ⩽
            (
        N
        (
          |
        f
            |
            p
        )
              )
              1
              p
            (
        N
        (
          |
        g
            |
            q
        )
              )
              1
              q
        ,
    {\displaystyle \forall f,g\in F(S,\mathbb {C} )\qquad N(|fg|)\leqslant {\bigl (}N(|f|^{p}){\bigr )}^{\frac {1}{p}}{\bigl (}N(|g|^{q}){\bigr )}^{\frac {1}{q}},}
where the numbers 
        p
    {\displaystyle p}
   and 
        q
    {\displaystyle q}
   are Hölder conjugates.
Remark: If (S, Σ, μ) is a measure space and 
        N
        (
        f
        )
    {\displaystyle N(f)}
   is the upper Lebesgue integral of 
          |
        f
          |
    {\displaystyle |f|}
   then the restriction of N to all Σ-measurable functions gives the usual version of Hölder's inequality.
Cauchy–Schwarz inequality
Minkowski inequality
Jensen's inequality
Young's inequality
