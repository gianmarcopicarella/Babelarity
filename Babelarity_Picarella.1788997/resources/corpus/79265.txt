Khara, Inc. (株式会社カラー, Kabushiki gaisha Karā, stylized as khara, Inc.) is a Japanese animation studio best known for its work on the Rebuild of Evangelion film tetralogy. Studio khara (スタジオカラー, Sutajio Karā) is the primary animation production studio. It was founded by Hideaki Anno in May 2006, and was shown publicly on 1 August when recruitment notices were posted on his website; Anno remains its president. It has built up appropriate infrastructure. The name khara comes from the Greek word χαρα, meaning joy.
Anno left Gainax and transitioned to Khara; as part of his public statements on the Rebuild films, he wrote:
"For this purpose, we are not returning to our roots at Gainax. I have set up a production company and studio, and it is in this new setting that we will start again. Without looking back, without admiration for the circumstances, we aim to walk towards the future. Thankfully, we have gathered staff from the old series, new staff, and many other fantastic staff to work on this series. We realize that we are creating something that will be better than the last series." 
Key contributors brought back to work on the new project include assistant director Kazuya Tsurumaki, character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, story board artist Shinji Higuchi and composer Shirō Sagisu.
