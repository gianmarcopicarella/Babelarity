The national emblem of Mozambique was adopted in 1990 in the Constitution of Mozambique article 194. The Article clearly states the design and meaning of the device. It shows a gear wheel, bordered by corn stalks and sugarcane. In the middle there is a red sun over a map of Mozambique in green, and blue waves, an AK-47 crossed with a hoe, and a book. The wreath is tied with a ribbon bearing the name of the country. The emblem is "socialist heraldry" style similar to those of the Soviet republics.
As described in the Mozambican constitution article 194, the various parts of the emblem have a special symbolism, i.e.
the corn stalk and the sugar cane represent agricultural wealth
the cog wheel represents labor and industry
the book represents education
the hoe for "peasantry and agriculture production"
the AK-47 for "defense and vigilance"
the red star represents socialism, but is quoted in the Mozambican constitution to "symbolize the spirit of international solidarity of the Mozambican people".
the red sun symbolizes the building of a new life
