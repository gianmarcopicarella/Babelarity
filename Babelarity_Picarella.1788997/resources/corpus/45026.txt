Aldean was born as Jason Aldine Williams in Macon, Georgia, in the United States. His parents, Barry and Debbie, divorced when he was three. He was raised by his mother, in Macon, where he went to high school at Windsor Academy. During the summer, he would spend time with his father in Homestead, Florida.
Before going to work during the day, his dad would map out guitar chords on notebook paper to show Aldean where to place his fingers to play the chords. Aldean sat and practiced all day while his dad was at work. When his dad got home, he got out his own guitar and they played together. Soon, after hearing a song only a few times, he could play it. His early favorites included George Strait's "The Cowboy Rides Away", Hank Williams Jr.'s "The Blues Man", and Alabama's "My Home's in Alabama". Both of his parents encouraged young Aldean as he progressed musically. From age 14, after watching the country-music awards on television, he wanted to perform on stage. With his mother's help, he performed at the local VFW hall in Macon, Georgia. He sang John Anderson's song "Seminole Wind" and Tracy Lawrence's "Sticks and Stones". He would later say that the entire audience – all ten – applauded, and that he almost had to be dragged off the stage because he was hooked on performing. He then began performing at area talent contests and local fairs. At 15, he joined the "house band" at Georgia nightspot Nashville South.
Aldean chose his stage name as there were already a number of people called "Jason Williams" including a well-known basketball player. In order to stand out, he changed the spelling of his middle name, Aldine, to come up with the name Aldean.
Aldean married his high school sweetheart, Jessica Ussery, on August 4, 2001. Together the couple have two daughters, Kendyl and Keeley. On April 25, 2013, seven months after Aldean admitted to acting inappropriately with former American Idol contestant Brittany Kerr, news outlets reported Aldean and his wife had separated in January. Aldean filed for divorce on April 26, citing irreconcilable differences. Aldean and Kerr officially began dating in March 2014 and made their first public appearance as a couple at the 2014 CMT Awards. and on September 24, 2014, Aldean and Kerr announced their engagement. The couple were married on March 21, 2015.
Along with former Major League Baseball (MLB) players Adam LaRoche , Ryan Langerhans, and Tombo Martin, Willie Robertson of Duck Dynasty, and fellow country singer Luke Bryan, Aldean owns a hunting company called Buck Commander.
Aldean owns 1,300 acres (5.3 km2) of land just outside Nashville, Tennessee dubbed "Black Jack Ridge".
Jason is a Georgia Bulldogs fan and spends every Saturday he can watching games. He played the first-ever concert at the University of Georgia's Sanford Stadium for over 60,000 fans in April 2013, and Ludacris happened to make an appearance for their collaboration of "Dirt Road Anthem." Aldean has a bulldog named Athens, for the location of the university and also has a “Man Barn” at his home, which includes televisions, a full bar, leather couches, and Georgia Bulldogs decorations which is under renovation.
In 2015, Forbes estimated Aldean's annual income at $43.5 million.
After high school, with his father's help, Aldean and his band performed at Truman State University (previously Northeast Missouri State University) in Kirksville, Missouri. With Justin Weaver (one of the band's members), Aldean began writing songs. In 1998, he performed his original songs at a showcase staged by Atlanta nightclub The Buckboard. He was approached by Michael Knox, then of the Warner-Chappell song-publishing company. After signing with Warner-Chappell, Aldean moved to Nashville on November 1, 1998, at age 21.
Aldean was offered a recording contract but was subsequently dropped. He signed with another label but again was dropped in 2000 for postponing his recording sessions repeatedly. Various showcases failed to bring him a contract. The last straw was an attempt at the Wildhorse Saloon where the promised label talent scouts never even showed up. Finally, Lawrence Mathis spotted Aldean at one of the showcases at The Wildhorse Saloon in Nashville. He signed as Aldean's first manager. Still frustrated and discouraged with his struggling career, Aldean gave himself 6 months before planning to leave Nashville and return home to Georgia. Then 5 weeks later, he was offered a deal from Broken Bow Records in Nashville. Shortly after the release of his self-titled debut album, Aldean picked up his new (and current) agent Kevin Neal. Furthermore, while recording Relentless, Aldean moved to Clarence Spalding and Spalding Entertainment for management.

In an interview with Shave Magazine, Aldean explained that working with Bryan on Crossroads "was great" and that "[h]e was a lot of fun." But the real highlight for him was that he was working with Randy Owen. "I am a big fan of Alabama so I got a chance to work with Randy Owen on this album (it didn’t make the album but it eventually made a bonus track). It was really cool. Alabama were like ‘The Beatles’ for me so working with him was definitely one of the highlights," he said "I mean, both of those guys were really cool moments, but if I had to pick one highlight, it would be working with Randy [Owen] this year."
