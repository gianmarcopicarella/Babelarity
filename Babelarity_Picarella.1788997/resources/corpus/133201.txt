This page is about the Roman river-god. For Vulturnus, the Roman god of the east wind, see Anemoi. For the University of Maine-developed VolturnUS, a floating offshore wind turbine, see Floating Wind Turbines.
In Roman mythology, Volturnus was a god of the waters, probably derived from a local Samnite cult. His festival, Volturnalia, was held on August 27.
The Volturno river in Campania is named in his honour.
