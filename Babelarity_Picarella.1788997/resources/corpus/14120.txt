Armindo Tué Na Bangna (born 24 October 1994), known as Bruma, is a Portuguese footballer who plays for Turkish club Galatasaray SK as a winger, skill and speed being his main assets.
Born in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau, Bruma moved to Portugal as a child, joining Sporting Clube de Portugal's academy before his 13th birthday. He proceeded to score more than 80 goals for the club's various youth sides.
Bruma made his senior debuts in the 2012–13 season, starting with the B-team in the second division. On 6 December 2012 he netted twice against C.F. União, but was also sent off and his team lost the away game 2–3.
On 10 February 2013, at the age of 18, Bruma made his official debut with the Lions' main squad, playing the first half of the 0–1 loss against C.S. Marítimo. He scored his first Primeira Liga goal the following matchday, netting the opener in a 3–2 win at Gil Vicente FC.
On 3 September 2013, after a lengthy and sour contract dispute with Sporting, ultimately resolved in the club's favour, Bruma signed a five-year deal with Turkish giants Galatasaray SK for €10 million. He made his debut ten days later against Antalyaspor, coming on as a substitute in a 1–1 draw.
Bruma made his maiden UEFA Champions League appearance on 17 September 2013, playing roughly 30 minutes in a 1–6 home loss to Real Madrid for the group stage. He made his first assist for his new club in a local derby against Beşiktaş JK, in a 2–1 away victory, and scored his first goal against Balıkesirspor on 18 December, in a 4–0 win for the campaign's Turkish Cup.
On 15 January 2014, also in the domestic cup but against Tokatspor, Bruma suffered a serious knee injury, going on to be sidelined for most of the season. Due to this and the restriction on foreign players allowed per team, he was loaned to fellow Süper Lig club Gaziantepspor for the remainder of the season, failing to play any matches.
Bruma was loaned to Spanish side Real Sociedad in the 2015 off-season, in a season-long deal. He made his La Liga debut on 22 August, starting and playing 85 minutes in a 0–0 away draw against Deportivo de La Coruña.
Bruma scored his first competitive goal for the Basques on 3 December 2015, in a 1–2 loss at UD Las Palmas for the Copa del Rey (2–3 on aggregate). His first in the league arrived 27 days later, as he came on as an early substitute for injured Imanol Agirretxe and netted the 1–1 equaliser against Real Madrid, but in an eventual 1–3 defeat at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.
Still aged 18, Bruma was part of the Portuguese under-20 side that competed in the 2013 FIFA World Cup in Turkey. He was awarded the Silver Shoe as second top scorer of the tournament, scoring five times in four games in an eventual round-of-16 exit.
Bruma played his first game for the under-21s on 10 October 2013, 14 days shy of his 19th birthday, and he netted the second from a close-range header in an eventual 3–0 home win against Israel for the 2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifiers. Just two days later he was called by full side manager Paulo Bento, replacing suspended Cristiano Ronaldo for the last 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Luxembourg.
Bruma's older brother, Mesca, is also a footballer and a winger. He too played youth football for Sporting, also spending his formative years at Chelsea and Fulham.
