Porto União is a city located in the Northern Plateau in the State of Santa Catarina and in the left bank of Iguazu River, bordering the city of União da Vitória, Paraná. In 2006, its population was estimated in 33,318 inhabitants.
The history of Porto União has always been intrinsically connected with the Iguazu River and with União da Vitória -- considered its twin city—as well.
It all began in 1842 with the discovery of the 'Vau do Iguaçu' (literally meaning 'Iguazu Ford'), the best connection between the South and the Southeast Region, where the army troops just as people from Rio Grande do Sul known as 'tropeiros' used to cross the river with their oxen in order to sell them in São Paulo and Minas Gerais. It was also an important stop point for those who used the river in transportation, receiving its first name: Porto da União (Harbour of Union). In a few years, the area rapidly developed.
The small village grows and in 1855 its name is changed to Porto União da Vitória. In the same year, immigration begins with Germans, Poles, Ukrainians, Italians, Austrians and Russians. In 1901, its name changes to União da Vitória.
In 1912, the Contestado War takes place and in September 5, 1917 the municipality of Porto União is created.
In the 1950s, both cities, União da Vitória and Porto União, reach their economic and regional importance apex caused by the growth of the native wood market and yerba mate as well.
Nowadays, the city, just like its twin, lives of the non-native wood market and tourism.
