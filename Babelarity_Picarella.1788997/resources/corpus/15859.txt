Antonio Piedra Pérez (born 10 October 1985) is a Spanish professional road bicycle racer who rides for UCI Professional Continental Team Caja Rural–Seguros RGA.
Born in Seville, Piedra has competed as a professional since 2007, competing for the Fuerteventura-Canarias and Andalucía–Cajasur teams, before joining the Caja Rural team for the 2012 season. Piedra took a prestigious victory by winning the Rogaland GP in May 2012, soloing away to win by 35 seconds over his nearest challenger. He participated in the 2012 Vuelta a España, his team being invited as a 'wildcard', and had a major victory on stage 15, a high mountain affair finishing atop the Lakes of Covadonga climb. Piedra followed a move that formed on the first climb of the day, and dropped his breakaway companions on the final difficulty of the race, the first "Hors Category" climb of the Vuelta. He had 2 minutes and 2 seconds of an advantage over his nearest competitor, Euskaltel–Euskadi's Rubén Pérez.
