In 1980, at the time when Arjun Singh was the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, a committee was formed to find out more about the educational system in Sidhi district. It was tasked to find out which was the first school in Sidhi district, and also, who was the first graduate.
It was popularly thought that Rajasahab of Madhwas was the first graduate from Sidhi. The survey further revealed that Shri Divakar Bahadur Singh, village Jhalwar (Churhat), was the first graduate from Allahabad University. He had done his BA in 1924 and had proceeded to do his LLB also from Allahabd University in 1926. Thereafter he had come back to practice and settle in Jhalwar (Churaht) in Sidhi district. His successors are still present in Jhalwar. Among them, Batuk Pratap Singh (Jhalwar) is the source of information regarding the history events in the district.
It was also found that the first school in Sidhi was in Bardi. This school had started around 100 years before the survey, i.e., around the year 1880
