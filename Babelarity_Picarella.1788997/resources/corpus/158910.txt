Halti (Finnish: Haltitunturi, Northern Sami: Háldičohkka, Swedish: Haldefjäll) is the highest fell in Finland, at 1,324 m (4,344 ft) above sea level, and thus the highest point in the country. The Halti fell is located in the municipality of Enontekiö in the province of Lapland at the border between Finland and Norway.
The summit of Halti, at 1,365 m (4,478 ft), is actually in Norway and is known as ''Ráisduattarháldi''. The peak is located on the border between the municipalities of Nordreisa and Gáivuotna–Kåfjord, about 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) north of the border with Finland.
The highest point in Finland is a spur of Ráisduattarháldi at 1,324 m (4,344 ft) known as Hálditšohkka at the border of Norway. The highest mountain whose peak is in Finland is Ridnitšohkka, at 1,316 m (4,318 ft). Halti was measured and mapped by the Finnish person Erkki Perä.
In 2015, a group of Norwegians began a campaign to give the peak of Hálditšohkka to Finland for its centenary in 2017 by moving the border between the two countries by 200 m (660 ft).
A 50 km (31 mi) trekking path leads from Saana, Kilpisjärvi to Halti.
