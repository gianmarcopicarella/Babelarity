In number theory, a natural number is called almost prime if there exists an absolute constant K such that the number has at most K prime factors. An almost prime n is denoted by Pr if and only if the number of prime factors of n, counted according to multiplicity, is at most r. A natural number is called k-almost prime if it has exactly k prime factors, counted with multiplicity. More formally, a number n is k-almost prime if and only if Ω(n) = k, where Ω(n) is the total number of primes in the prime factorization of n:
        Ω
        (
        n
        )
        :=
        ∑
          a
            i
          if
        n
        =
        ∏
          p
            i
              a
                i
        .
    {\displaystyle \Omega (n):=\sum a_{i}\qquad {\mbox{if}}\qquad n=\prod p_{i}^{a_{i}}.}
A natural number is thus prime if and only if it is 1-almost prime, and semiprime if and only if it is 2-almost prime. The set of k-almost primes is usually denoted by Pk. The smallest k-almost prime is 2k. The first few k-almost primes are:
The number πk(n) of positive integers less than or equal to n with at most k prime divisors (not necessarily distinct) is asymptotic to:
