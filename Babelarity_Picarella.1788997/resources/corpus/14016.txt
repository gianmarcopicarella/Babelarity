His first A-League goal for Brisbane came in the Round 10, midweek clash with Central Coast Mariners at Suncorp Stadium with a powerful volley from outside of the box. His goal was made famous for his team's "human kayak" celebration. Brisbane won the game 2–0. Playing as a wingback, Franjic has impressed at the Roar.
In Round 17, Franjic scored an equalising goal against the North Queensland Fury in the 85th minute. The game ended 1–1.

Franjic was one of six Brisbane Roar players to be selected in the All-Star Team for the 2010–11 season. Goal.com named Franjic as one of five Australian defenders in the A-League who are ready to play in Europe.
In 2012, Franjic played in the 2012 A-League Grand Final against Perth Glory, where he scored an own goal to give Perth an unlikely lead. Brisbane managed to claw back and take the lead courtesy of two late goals from Besart Berisha, becoming the first A-League side to win the championship two years in succession.
In August 2014, Franjic moved to newly promoted Russian Premier League side FC Torpedo Moscow, signing a three-year contract at the club. Franjic made his debut for Torpedo on 25 October 2014, in a 0-0 home draw against FC Kuban Krasnodar, coming on as a half-time substitute for Ivan Novoseltsev. During January 2015 Torpedo blocked a loan move for Franjic back to the A-League, with Franjic later being linked with a move to Dinamo Zagreb during the summer of 2015. He quit Torpedo Moscow due to unpaid wages on 23 April 2015.
Just over a month after leaving Russia, Franjic was unveiled as A-League side Melbourne City FC's first signing of the summer. Signing a three-year deal, Franjic expressed his pleasure at returning to his home town, and cited the prospect of first team football as a key factor in his decision to join City, particularly in light of his desire to retain his place in the Socceroos starting line-up.
