The August Prize (Swedish: Augustpriset) is an annual Swedish literary prize that has been given out since 1989 by the Swedish Publishers' Association.
For its first three years, there was only one general category for awards. From 1992, the prize has been awarded in the categories Fiction, Non-Fiction, and Children's and Youth Literature. The prize is named after the writer August Strindberg.
All Swedish publishers may submit nominations for the award. In each category, a jury shortlists six titles each. These titles are then read and voted on by an assembly of 63 electors, 21 in each category. The electors come from across the country, and comprise booksellers, librarians and literary critics. The books receiving the largest number of votes win the prize.
The prizes are handed out at the Berwaldhallen in Stockholm. Winners receive 100,000 Swedish krona and a bronze statuette by the artist Michael Fare.
