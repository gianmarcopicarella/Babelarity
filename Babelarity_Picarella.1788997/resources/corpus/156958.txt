The Jialing River (Chinese: 嘉陵江; pinyin: Jīalíng jiāng; Wade–Giles: chia-ling-chiang) is a tributary of the Yangtze River with its source in Gansu province. It gets its name from its crossing the Jialing Vale in Feng County of Shaanxi. It was once known as Langshui (simplified Chinese: 阆水; traditional Chinese: 閬水; pinyin: làngshǔi) or Yushui (渝水; Pinyin: yúshǔi).
The Jialing River is 1,119 kilometres (695 mi) long.
Its source lies in Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture, in Sichuan.
The middle course is between Zhaohua and Hechuan. Below Hechuan to where it joins the Yangtze in Chongqing is the lower reaches of the river.
The Jialing River's most notable characteristic is its sinuous course. From Zhangwang Miao (Temple of Zhangfei) in Guangyuan to Longdongtuo in Hechuan, the distance as the crow flies is only slightly more than 200 kilometres (120 mi). However the river itself travels over 600 kilometres (370 mi). The most tortuous part of its course is between Nanchong and Wusheng.
There are large number of tributaries along the Jialing. The largest tributaries include Fu River (also known as Sui He) and Qu River, both of which flow into the Jialing at Hechuan, a small city in Chongqing Municipal area.
The Jialing River supports a vast amount of bio-diversity.
An amazing total of 151 species of fish inhabit the river, of which 51 species are endemic to the Yangtze River.
