In the year 40 the Romans populated the town as a farmer/military outpost and kept its Celtic name. The local territory formed the civilian district of Civitas Ulpia Sueborum Nicretum ("Neckarsuebi"), of which Lopodunum was the chief town. In 74 AD the Romans founded the town Auxiliarkastelle which included a supply-keeping town, which was the center of the future town. The garrison included a regiment of cavalry made up from the Canaefaten.
