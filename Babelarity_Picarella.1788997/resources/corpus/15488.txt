Dexter Jerome Pittman (born March 2, 1988) is an American professional basketball player for Santeros de Aguada of the Baloncesto Superior Nacional (BSN). He played college basketball for the University of Texas.
Pittman was a three-year starter at B. F. Terry High School, where he averaged 15 points and 8.5 rebounds per game over his career. In his senior season, he was named the Most Valuable Player for District 24-4A.
Considered a three-star recruit by Rivals.com, Pittman was listed as the No. 16 center and the No. 150 player in the nation in 2006.
Pittman was used sparingly in his first two seasons at Texas, averaging less than 3 points per game with just one start. As a junior, he started 24 games–averaging 10 points and 5.5 rebounds per game–and became one of the most dominant centers in the Big 12 conference.
Pittman weighed 388 lbs  as a senior at Terry High School. After receiving weight loss tips from Texas' Strength and Conditioning coach Todd Wright, he was able to drop his weight to 366 lbs before enrolling at Texas. His weight still prevented him from doing basic drills in practice, which caused various back and knee aches. Pittman then dedicated himself to a workout program with Wright, which included 5:30 AM workouts and a complete revamp of his diet. Pittman agreed to call Todd Wright before every meal to evaluate his choices. He later characterized the workout regimen as so tough that "I wanted to cry and say, 'Man, I want to give up'". Since losing almost 100 pounds, he has become an icon for admirers, like Hall of Famer Charles Barkley, who heard about his weight loss.
