Xagħra (Maltese: Ix-Xagħra) is a village on the island of Gozo in Malta. It is possibly the earliest inhabited part of Gozo, being home to the Ġgantija megalithic temples, the Xagħra Stone Circle, as well as natural underground features such as Xerri's Grotto and Ninu's Cave. It is the largest village in Gozo after the capital Victoria, with a population of 4,886 people as of March 2014. During the British period of its history, Xagħra was known as Caccia by foreign residents.
Xagħra Parish is dedicated to Our Lady of Victories, locally known as 'il-Bambina'. The liturgical feast is celebrated on the 8th day of September each year and is a crowd puller as it as the last feast in the summer festa season.
Xagħra Scout Group (XSG) has been re-activated and mainly run by youths themselves since 2008. XSG has been open several times notably in 1934, the 1950s and 1970s. During the 1930s period both the Victory Band Club and Xaghra United F.C. emerged from XSG to form their own entities after the war was over. Today the co-ed group boasts around 70 members ranging from the smallest 5 year old beavers to GSL-Emeretius and lifelong member Vincent Vella. The group has recently obtained a lease on a dilapidated property from the Government and is currently restoring it to its former glory to serve as a scouting home for its members. The property is situated at the end of Triq ta' Hamet and is just in front the local playing field and football ground.
