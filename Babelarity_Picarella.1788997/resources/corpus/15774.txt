The Stockholm Open (currently sponsored by If) is a tennis event on the ATP Tour held in Stockholm, Sweden in the end of October or beginning of November each year. The tournament is owned by The Royal Lawn Tennis Club of Stockholm 40%, SALK (Stockholm Public Lawn Tennis Club) 40% and Tennis Stockholm 20%.
The first Stockholm Open was held in 1969 and it has been played each year ever since. The tournament is played on indoor hard-court and features both men's singles and doubles tournament. In 1975, 1979, and 1980, a short-lived women's competition was held, which was played on carpet.
In March 1969 the World Championship Tennis organization made a request to former tennis player Sven Davidson to organize a tournament in Sweden. This led to the inaugural edition of the Stockholm Open in November 1969 in Kungliga tennishallen in Stockholm. It has been held there ever since except for the years 1989 to 1994 when it was held in the Ericsson Globe Arena. Between 1970 and 1989 it was a major ranking tournament of the Grand Prix Tennis Tour as part of the Grand Prix Super Series (except from 1981 to 1983, when it was briefly downgraded).
From 1990 until 1994 it was an ATP Championship Series Single Week event. Since 1995, the tournament has been downgraded from Super 9 status offering $1.72 million in prize money to ATP World Tour 250 series level with â‚¬600,000 prize money.
