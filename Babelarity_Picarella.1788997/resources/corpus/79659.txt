A Brief Vacation (Italian: Una breve vacanza) is a 1973 Italian melodrama directed by Vittorio de Sica. The script, written by Cesare Zavattini, was inspired by an Apollinaire adage ("Sickness is the vacation of the poor").
The film concerns a female factory worker from Calabria who falls ill on the job and is prescribed a stay at a mountain retreat. She goes despite her husband's wishes, leaving behind her thankless work shift and her frustrating in-laws, but also her three children. The film addresses issues such as the health care system, labor conditions, spousal satisfaction, and class struggle.
