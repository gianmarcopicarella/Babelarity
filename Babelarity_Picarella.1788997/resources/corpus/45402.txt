At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 63, based on four reviews. Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times calls Party Rock a mixture of the "same pleasures as those remixes: thumping 1980s-inspired beats, instantly catchy synth hooks, shouty catchphrases about how "what happens at the party stays at the party." Ginger Clements of Billboard said that "DJ/rappers Redfoo and Sky Blu (the son and grandson, respectively, of Motown founder Berry Gordy) fulfill all the lyrical requirements for a summer anthem—sunny locale, sexual tension and a liquor-assisted nonstop party." John Bush of Allmusic called Party Rock "an indulgent record with plenty of fun and immaturity, but a real need for a growing musical identity." Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone calls Party Rock "a mixture of sleazy jams, booty boasts and enough irony to clog your Jacuzzi."
