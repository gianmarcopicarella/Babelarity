Pyrantel is an antinematodal thiophene. It is often prescribed by veterinarians to treat and prevent the occurrence of intestinal parasites in small animal pets.
It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most important medication needed in a basic health system.
Pyrantel is a nicotinic receptor agonist. Like levamisole and the related pyrimidine morantel, it can elicit spastic muscle paralysis in parasitic worms due to prolonged activation of the excitatory nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) receptors on body wall muscle. This has been studied in body wall muscle preparation of the parasitic nematode Ascaris.
