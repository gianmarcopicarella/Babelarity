Ibiúna is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of Sorocaba. The population is 76,432 (2015 est.) in an area of 1058.08 km². The elevation is 860 m.
Located in the middle of a valley, its main economical activity/resources are provided from agriculture (developed by the hundreds of Japanese immigrants established there) and the city has been recently turned to a tourist city a few years ago. The whole Ibiuna territory encompasses rainforests, bushes, and hundreds of kilometers of native vegetation and wildlife.
The population is mostly situated outside the metropolitan area (15,000 inhabitants in the city and approximatedly 65,000 in the suburbs) and is a mix of Portuguese Colonialists descendants, Italians, Germans and Africans — as mostly any part of the country, Ibiuna is a mix of races and cultures. Once a year, the city held the famous "San Sebastian festival" party celebrated for nearly a century to reaffirm the faith of town's divine intervention by St. Sebastian during a Spanish influenza epidemic (the celebration occurs every year during the last weekend of May).
Recently, the small town was elected by a research as one of the most violent cities of the São Paulo state due to its proximity to the capital and its vast territory which is spread alongside 900 km of roads too extensive to be covered and screened for criminals.
