Trimeniaceae is a family of flowering plants recognized by most taxonomists, at least for the past several decades. It is a small family of one genus with eight known species (Christenhusz & Byng 2016) of woody plants, bearing essential oils. The family is subtropical to tropical and found in Southeast Asia, eastern Australia and on several Pacific Islands.

The APG system, of 1998, also recognized this family, but left it unplaced as to order, and regarded it as being among the most basal lineages in the clade angiosperms.

the order Laurales,
in subclass Magnoliidae,
in class Magnoliopsida [=dicotyledons],

The Thorne system (1992) accepted this family and placed it in
