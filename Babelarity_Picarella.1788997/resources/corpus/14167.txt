Estadio Brigadier General Estanislao Lopez (nicknamed "El Cementerio de Los Elefantes") is a football stadium in Santa Fe, Argentina. It is the home stadium of Club Atlético Colón. The stadium has a capacity of 47,000, and was first opened in 1946.
The ground's nickname (Elephants Graveyard in English) was created in 1964, as a result of the unexpected defeat of the Brazilian team Santos FC led by Pelé. The frequent defeats of the major Argentine teams strengthened the reputation.
It has also been used occasionally for Argentina rugby internationals, most recently in 2007 for a test against Ireland.
