Both components of the binary star are a white A-type main sequence dwarfs. They have apparent magnitudes of +4.2 and +4.5, which gives the system a combined apparent magnitude of +3.60. The orbital period of the binary is 35.6 years (13,007.2 days), and the two stars are separated by 0.18 arcseconds.
The traditional name Talitha' (share with ι UMa) comes from the Arabic phrase Al Fiḳrah al Thalitha "the third spring, or leap, of the ghazal". The term Australis meaning "the south side" in Latin.
In Chinese, 三台 (Sān Tái), meaning Three Steps, refers to an asterism consisting of κ Ursae Majoris, ι Ursae Majoris, λ Ursae Majoris, μ Ursae Majoris, ν Ursae Majoris and ξ Ursae Majoris.
