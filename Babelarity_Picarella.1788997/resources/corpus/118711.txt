236 Honoria is a large main belt asteroid that was discovered by Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa on April 26, 1884 in Vienna. The asteroid was named after Honoria, granddaughter of the Roman Emperor Theodosius I, who started negotiations with Attila the Hun. It is classified as a stony S-type asteroid based upon its spectrum.
Polarimetric study of this asteroid reveals anomalous properties that suggests the regolith consists of a mixture of low and high albedo material. This may have been caused by fragmentation of an asteroid substrate with the spectral properties of CO3/CV3 carbonaceous chondrites.
