Bumpety Boo (へーい!ブンブー, Hēi! Bumbū, Hey! Bumboo) is an anime children's television show produced by the Nippon Animation company from 1985 to 1986. The series consists of 130 10-minute episodes, distributed as 43 half-hour segments.
The show follows the adventures of a young boy named Ken, who has always dreamed of owning a car, and Bumpety Boo, a talking yellow car who hatched from an egg in the first episode, as they travel the world in search for Bumpety Boo's mother. Bumpety Boo, the fun-loving car, makes friends with Ken. Teaming up seems like a natural thing, but Bumpety Boo does not count on Ken's adventurous eight-year-old spirit. Throughout the series, Dr. Monkey tries to steal Bumpety Boo from Ken.
During their expedition, they have great adventures and help a lot of people they encounter on their way. They also encounter other talking cars. Bumpety Boo usually races them and always wins because of his strength and speed, which he receives after he smells flowers. In the end of the series the group finds his mother.
In the early 1990s, there were several VHS tapes that had episodes of the show dubbed in English by Saban Entertainment. They were released by Celebrity Home Entertainment's Just For Kids Division. The show was aired on free to air television in Australia in the mid 90s.
