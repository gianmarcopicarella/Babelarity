The Wiener Börse AG (also known as the Vienna Stock Exchange) is the only stock exchange in Vienna, Austria, and one of the most established exchanges in Eastern- and Southeastern Europe.
Wiener Börse is one of the world's oldest exchanges and was founded in 1771 during the reign of Empress Maria Theresa of Austria in order to provide a market for state issued bonds.
The crash on 9 May 1873, of the Vienna Stock Exchange – the so-called "Gründerkrach" or "founders’ crash" – was part of a worldwide downturn which, in the US, led to the September 1873 bankruptcy of the Philadelphia banking firm Jay Cooke. The Panic of 1873 and Long Depression followed.
Today, the Vienna Stock Exchange operates the only securities exchange in Austria as well as the Energy Exchange Austria, EXAA, and the CEGH Gas Exchange of the Vienna Stock Exchange. It provides trading infrastructure (XETRA), market data and information to ensure the execution of stock exchange transactions and facilitate the interaction among all market participants.
The core business of the exchange is the operation of a cash market (equity market, bond market) as well as a market for trading in structured products. Additional services include data vending, index development and management and specialized financial market seminars and training courses.
The Austrian Traded Index (ATX), the leading index of Wiener Börse, tracks the price trends of the blue chips on Wiener Börse in real time. The composition of the ATX is reviewed every year in March and September. The main criteria for inclusion or deletion are the capitalized free float and stock exchange trading volumes.
The Vienna Stock Exchange is a 100% subsidiary of the holding CEESEG AG.
