Králův Dvůr (pronounced [ˈkraːluːf dvuːr], German: Königshof) is a town in the Central Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic. It is located very close to Beroun. It has a population of 6,201 (2006).
The first mention of this town was written in 1394. In the first half of the 13th century, Wenceslaus I probably built a medieval yard in this town.
In 1930, Králův Dvůr attained the status of městys. It was upgraded to town on 5 October 2004.[2]
Since 1988, a D5 motorway has led through the town, which caused the town to not have a natural town centre.
