Guldbollen, (eng. the Golden Ball), is a Swedish football award given by the Aftonbladet and the Swedish Football Association to the best male Swedish footballer each year.
The first award was given in 1946 to Gunnar Gren, and was created by Bengt Liljedahl. From 1946-65, the awarded was given out in cooperation with Stockholms-Tidningen.
The current holderer is Zlatan Ibrahimović, who is the only player to win the award ten times (2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015). Bo Larsson of Malmö FF was the first player to win the award more than once, in 1965 and 1973. Diamantbollen, the female equivalent of the award, was established in 1990. Both awards are given out at the same gala.
