Philibert de Chalon (18 March 1502 – 3 August 1530) was the last prince of Orange from the house of Chalon.
Born at Nozeroy to John IV of Chalon-Arlay, Philibert served Emperor Charles V as commander in Italy, fighting in the War of the League of Cognac. He took part in the Sack of Rome (1527) and was killed during the final stages of the siege of Florence (1530). An interesting exchange of letters during the siege between him and Charles still survives.
He was succeeded as prince of Orange by his sister's son, Renatus of Nassau-Breda (René of Chalon), who thus became the founder of the House of Orange-Nassau.
