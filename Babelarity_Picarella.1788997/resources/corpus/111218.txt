Princess Marie-Thérèse of France (2 January 1667 – 1 March 1672) was the fourth child and third daughter of Louis XIV of France and his Spanish wife Infanta Maria Teresa of Spain. As the king's daughter, she was a Fille de France and was known at court by the traditional honorific of Madame Royale because she was the king's eldest surviving daughter. She did not survive childhood.
Marie-Thérèse de France was born 2 January 1667 at the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Her parents had her baptised in the Palais du Louvre in 1668. Her parents reputedly adored the young girl, and her mother wanted her to become the queen of her native Spain. As a Fille de France, Marie-Thérèse was referred to as Her Royal Highness and had de France as her surname.
She was also known as La Petite Madame to distinguish her from her aunts, the wives of her uncle Monsieur, who were known as the first Madame (died 1670) and the second Madame (died 1722). The young princess died on 1 March 1672 at the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye.
