Progress met the south when President Eisenhower proposed a new road system that would allow travelers to get from place to place in record time, the interstate highways. The interstate was a major contributor to the demise of many downtowns. New areas of development came alongside these roadways as they were built.
Since World War II, many women had joined the workforce and did not have the time or luxury of staying home with children while father was at work. Quietly, the community's focus on town activities shifted from the town center to the new suburbs. Hotels were being built along the interstate to accommodate the travelers. Service stations and shopping areas were going where the development was occurring, on the interstate. The location along a major junction of highways made Tifton the ideal location for medical services serving a large (HSA 4140) geographic area.

The cause of the fire has never been given by local authorities. Currently, the tree and observation area are blocked from visitors by a gate. Although it no longer grows, the tree still stands. It is not known where the new second largest magnolia tree resides.
