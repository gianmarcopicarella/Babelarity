Interstate 16 (I-16), also known as Jim Gillis Historic Savannah Parkway is an Interstate Highway located entirely within the U.S. state of Georgia. It carries the hidden designation of State Route 404 (SR 404) for its entire length. I-16 travels from downtown Macon, at I-75 to downtown Savannah at Montgomery Street (Exit 167B). I-16's unsigned designation of State Route 404 has a spur that is signed in Savannah.
I-16 serves as a hurricane evacuation route for Savannah and other coastal areas. The road is designed for contraflow travel with railroad-type gates to block most entrance and exit ramps for the normally eastbound lanes. Some ramps are ungated, apparently for entrance to and exit from the contraflow lanes. Just east of exit 42 is a crossover to return all westbound traffic to the westbound travel lanes.
Southeast of Macon, I-16 travels through Ocmulgee National Monument but without direct access. Visitors need to first exit at the US 80/SR 87 (Coliseum Drive) exit.
I-16's only two rest areas are between exits 42 and 49 near Dudley.
The last part of the highway opened up on September 22, 1978, placing it in Emanuel, Candler, and Bulloch counties and completing the connection between downtown Macon and Savannah.
Until 2000, the state of Georgia used the sequential interchange numbering system on all of its Interstate Highways. The first exit on each highway would begin with the number "1" and increase numerically with each exit. In 2000, the Georgia Department of Transportation switched to a mileage-based exit system, in which the exit number corresponded to the nearest milepost.
In 2001 the Georgia Legislature passed a resolution, to designate the Earl T. Shinhoster Interchange at the interchange with Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard in Savannah in honor of Earl Shinhoster, who was a Black civil rights activist. This interchange is located in the economic and cultural center for Black Savannah.
In 2003, the Georgia Legislature passed a resolution to designate I-16 in honor of James L. Gillis, Sr., a Democrat who served as a State Representative, State Senator and Director of the Georgia Department of Transportation, as the Jim Gillis Historic Savannah Parkway. Gillis' sons, Hugh and James, Jr., also served as Democratic state legislators. Hugh was a Representative from 1941 to 1953 and a State Senator from 1953 to 1955 and from 1963 to 2005. James, Jr. was a State Senator from 1945 to 1946.
State Route 404 Spur (SR 404 Spur) is a 3.07-mile-long (4.94 km) spur route that travels from I-16 exit 166 northward along US 17 to the South Carolina state line. As its number suggests, it is a spur from SR 404, the unsigned route that is designated along the full length of I-16. At the northern end is the Talmadge Memorial Bridge.
Interstate 516 (I-516) is a 6.49-mile-long (10.44 km) auxiliary route from Garden City to DeRenne Avenue in Savannah, Georgia. It is also known as W.F. Lynes Parkway, and has a unsigned designation State Route 421.
