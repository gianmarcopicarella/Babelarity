Hugh I (1057 – August 29, 1093) was duke of Burgundy between 1076 and 1079. Hugh was son of Henry of Burgundy and grandson of duke Robert I. He inherited Burgundy from his grandfather, following the premature death of Henry, but abdicated shortly afterwards to his brother Eudes I. He briefly fought the Moors in the Iberian Peninsula with Sancho of Aragón. Hugh retired to a monastery, took vows as a monk and later became abbot of the Benedictine Abbey of Cluny. He married Sybil of Nevers, who died in 1078, but had no known descendants.
