Masashi Motoyama (本山 雅志, Motoyama Masashi, born June 20, 1979 in Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, Japan) is a Japanese football midfielder.
Motoyama started his career in 1998 with Japanese club Kashima Antlers, a club he has remained with ever since. Motoyama currently has 26 international caps for his country, although may pick up more in the future due to his versatility - he can operate either as an attacking midfielder or as a deep-lying forward, where his skillful dribbling and pace comes in handy. He competed at the 2000 Summer Olympics.
After 18 season with his beloved Kashima Antlers, he was released by the club on November 26. Anyway, he decided to come back home: he signed a contract with Giravanz Kitakyushu for 2016 season.
