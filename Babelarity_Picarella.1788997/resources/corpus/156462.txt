Cascade Locks is a city in Hood River County, Oregon, United States. The city took its name from a set of locks built to improve navigation past the Cascades Rapids of the Columbia River. The U.S. federal government approved the plan for the locks in 1875, construction began in 1878, and the locks were completed on November 5, 1896. The locks were subsequently submerged in 1938, replaced by Bonneville Lock and Dam, although the city lost no land from the expansion of Lake Bonneville behind the dam some 4 miles (6 km) downstream of the city. The city population was 1,144 at the 2010 census. The 2007 estimate is 1,075 residents.
Cascade Locks is just upstream from the Bridge of the Gods, a toll bridge that spans the Columbia River. It is the only bridge across the Columbia between Portland and Hood River. Cascade Locks is also a few miles upstream of Eagle Creek Gorge, a popular scenic area that doubles as an alternate route for the Pacific Crest Trail. Cascade Locks is used frequently by hikers along the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) to cross the Columbia River. Cascade Locks is the lowest point along the trail, which runs from the Mexican border in California to the Canadian border in Washington.
Since 1999, the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs have been pursuing an off-reservation casino to be sited in Cascade Locks. Since 2008, city officials have been pursuing an arrangement that would allow them to trade city well water for state-owned spring water and to sell it to Nestlé for bottling. In May, 2016, voters from all of Hood River County voted over 65% in favour of a ballot measure that essentially made Nestlé's plan inoperable from an economic sense. Voters in all precincts voted in favour of the measure (and against Nestlé); voters within Cascade Locks votes 58% against the measure (and in support of Nestlé's plans). In the wake of the election, Cascade Locks city leaders intend to follow the voters' desires and seek a new deal with Nestlé. Both Hood River County and Cascade Locks are governed by charter documents.

In April 2015, the city and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW), which uses water for a salmon hatchery, applied with the Oregon Water Resources Department to permanently trade public water rights at Oxbow Springs to Nestlé, a process that does not require a public-interest review. Nestlé had approached city officials with a water proposal in 2008. Since Oregon owns the rights to the spring, the city seeks to trade city well water for spring water and to sell the spring water to Nestlé. The plan has been criticized by legislators and 80,000 citizens. The 250,000-square-foot (23,000 m2), $50 million Nestlé bottling plant in Cascade Locks with an unemployment rate of 18.8 percent would have 50 employees and would increase property-tax collections by 67 percent.
