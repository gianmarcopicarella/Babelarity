The Stadio Friuli, commercially known as the Dacia Arena, is an all-seater football stadium in the Udine, Italy, and the home of Serie A club Udinese. The stadium was built in 1976 and has a capacity of 25,144.
Stadio Friuli is located in Rizzi, 4 km from the city centre of Udine.
Opened in 1976, as a replacement for Stadio Moretti, Friuli used to have a maximum capacity of 41,652 seats. This capacity was recently reduced to 25,144, when the Stadio Fruili underwent a reconstruction.
In April 2012, the City of Udine granted Udinese Calcio a 99-year lease of the stadium and land, due to end in 2112.
The most recent reconstruction saw the removal of the athletics track, the demolishing of three sides of the stadium with only the "arc" / West end preserved and the three demolished stands rebuilt closer to the pitch. The cost of the redevelopment was around €50m and the work was completed with Udinese not having to move any of their home games to other stadia. The work on the new stadium officially began on 5 June 2013. During the summer of 2013, the athletics track was dismantled. On 23 June 2014, the foundation stone was laid by Udinese Calcio president Giampaolo Pozzo. The new Friuli was officially opened on 17 January 2015 when Udinese hosted Juventus FC. The sponsorship name of the stadium, Dacia Arena, was unveiled that day.
The stadium also features facilities for fencing, gymnastics, martial arts and athletics, including an indoor gym, located in the grandstand.
In 1990, the stadium hosted three matches at the 1990 FIFA World Cup, all of which were Group E matches.
