The European Physical Journal (or EPJ) is a joint publication of EDP Sciences, Springer Science+Business Media, and the Società Italiana di Fisica. It arose in 1998 as a merger and continuation of Acta Physica Hungarica, Anales de Física, Czechoslovak Journal of Physics, Il Nuovo Cimento, Journal de Physique, Portugaliae Physica and Zeitschrift für Physik. The journal is published in various sections, covering all areas of physics.
In the late 1990s, Springer and EDP Sciences decided to merge Zeitschrift für Physik and Journal de Physique. With the addition of Il Nuovo Cimento from the Societa Italiana di Fisica, the European Physical Journal commenced publication in January 1998. Now EPJ is a merger and continuation of Acta Physica Hungarica, Anales de Fisica, Czechoslovak Journal of Physics, Il Nuovo Cimento, Journal de Physique, Portugaliae Physica and Zeitschrift für Physik.
The short-lived open-access journal family PhysMath Central was merged in 2011 into the European Physical Journal, which has offered an open-access option since 2006.
The EPJ is published in the following sections:
European Physical Journal A: Hadrons and Nuclei
European Physical Journal B: Condensed Matter and Complex Systems
European Physical Journal C: Particles and Fields
European Physical Journal D: Atomic, Molecular, Optical and Plasma Physics
European Physical Journal E: Soft Matter and Biological Physics
European Physical Journal H: Historical Perspectives on Contemporary Physics
European Physical Journal ST: Special Topics
European Physical Journal AP: Applied Physics
