An esterase is a hydrolase enzyme that splits esters into an acid and an alcohol in a chemical reaction with water called hydrolysis.
A wide range of different esterases exist that differ in their substrate specificity, their protein structure, and their biological function.
Acetylesterase (EC 3.1.1.6), splits off acetyl groups
Cholinesterase
Acetylcholinesterase, inactivates the neurotransmitter acetylcholine
Pseudocholinesterase, broad substrate specificity, found in the blood plasma and in the liver
Pectinesterase (EC 3.1.1.11), clarifies fruit juices
EC 3.1.2: Thiolester hydrolases
Thioesterase
Ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1
EC 3.1.3: Phosphoric monoester hydrolases
Phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.x), hydrolyses phosphoric acid monoesters into a phosphate ion and an alcohol
Alkaline phosphatase, removes phosphate groups from many types of molecules, including nucleotides, proteins, and alkaloids.
Phosphodiesterase (PDE), inactivates the second messenger cAMP
cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5, is inhibited by Sildenafil (Viagra)
Fructose bisphosphatase (3.1.3.11), converts fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to fructose-6-phosphate in gluconeogenesis
EC 3.1.4: Phosphoric diester hydrolases
EC 3.1.5: Triphosphoric monoester hydrolases
EC 3.1.6: Sulfuric ester hydrolases (sulfatases)
EC 3.1.7: Diphosphoric monoester hydrolases
EC 3.1.8: Phosphoric triester hydrolases
Exonucleases (deoxyribonucleases and ribonucleases)
EC 3.1.11: Exodeoxyribonucleases producing 5'-phosphomonoesters
EC 3.1.13: Exoribonucleases producing 5'-phosphomonoesters
EC 3.1.14: Exoribonucleases producing 3'-phosphomonoesters
EC 3.1.15: Exonucleases active with either ribo- or deoxy-
Endonucleases (deoxyribonucleases and ribonucleases)
Endodeoxyribonuclease
Endoribonuclease
either deoxy- or ribo-
