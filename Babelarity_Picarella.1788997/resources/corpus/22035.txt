Johanna Lindsey (born Johanna Helen Howard, March 10, 1952), is one of the most popular American writers of historical romance novels worldwide. All of her books reached the New York Times bestseller list, many reaching No. 1.
Her father was Edwin Dennis Howard, a soldier in the U.S. Army, stationed in Germany, where she was born. The family moved about a great deal when she was young. Her father always dreamed of retiring to Hawaii and after he died in 1964, Lindsey and her mother settled there to honor him.
In 1970, when she was still in school, she married Ralph Lindsey, becoming a young housewife. The marriage continued, the couple residing in Hawaii and producing three children; Alfred, Joseph and Garret, who already have made her a grandmother. After her husband's death, Lindsey moved to Maine and has not remarried.
Lindsey wrote her first book, Captive Bride in 1977 "on a whim". The book was a success, as have been the 49 novels which followed.
By 2006, over 58 Million copies of her books have been sold worldwide, with translations appearing in 12 languages.
Lindsey's books span various eras of history, including the Middle Ages, Regency England, the American "Old West", and the Viking age. She has written a few sci-fi romances. By far the most popular among her books are the stories about the Malory family (see Family Tree), a Regency saga.
Lindsey's stories are known for their feisty heroines and domineering heroes. Lindsey heroes are always Alpha-males, who are self-reliant, powerful, and overtly sexual.
