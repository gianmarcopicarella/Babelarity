Großenseebach is a village in the district of Erlangen-Höchstadt in Bavaria in Germany.
First mentioned in 1348, the village was completely destroyed in the Thirty Years' War. Großenseebach belonged to Prussia from 1803–1810, then to Bavaria and was assigned to the city of Herzogenaurach in 1811. Today's political community came into being in 1818. 1980 the free communities Großenseebach and Heßdorf created the "Verwaltungsgemeinschaft Heßdorf".
Today most inhabitants work for the big companies in Erlangen, such as Siemens.
