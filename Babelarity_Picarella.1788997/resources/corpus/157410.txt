Tiznit or Tiznet (Arabic: تزنيت‎‎, Amazigh: ⵜⵉⵣⵏⵉⵜ) is a town in the southern Moroccan region of Souss-Massa, founded in 1881 by the sultan Hassan I. It is the capital of Tiznit Province and has a population of approximately 50,000. Tiznit is well known for its silver jewelry, mint, daggers and sabres.
Located near the coast, Sultan Moulay Hassan settled in the area in 1881 to exert his control over dissident Berber tribes of the Souss. In 1912, Ahmed al-Hiba (El Hib), a populist rebel overthrew the French government and proclaimed himself sultan of Tiznit in the town's mosque. He conquered the Sous by uniting the tribes of the Anti Atlas Mountains. He went on to attack Marrakech but was suppressed by the French.
Tiznit is twinned with:
 Somerville, Massachusetts, United States (2010)
 Saint-Denis, France
British Blues Rock singer Ramon Goose used Tiznit as his subject matter for the song 'Long Road To Tiznit' from the album Desert Rock (Band) inspired by his travels in the region.
