Giuseppe Favalli (born 8 January 1972 in Orzinuovi, Province of Brescia) is a retired Italian footballer who played as a defender for Serie A clubs Lazio, Internazionale and Milan. A versatile, consistent, tenacious, successful, and experienced defender, Favalli was capable of playing as a centreback as well as on the left or right flank as a full-back.
He started his career with then-Serie B squad Cremonese. Following their promotion to Serie A in 1989 he made his top flight debut in a 2–1 defeat to Inter on 27 August 1989.
His strong performance resulted in him being signed by Lazio during the summer of 1992. Following the departure of Alessandro Nesta to Milan in 2002 he became team captain. During his time with Lazio he won a Scudetto, 3 Coppa Italia 2 Supercoppa Italiana and the UEFA Super Cup, as well as establishing himself as a fan favorite. In 12 seasons with the Biancocelesti he made 401 appearances in all competitions, scoring 6 goals.
He later moved to Internazionale joining the club on 1 June 2004 on a free transfer. With Inter he won the Coppa Italia twice, in 2005 and 2006 meaning he had won the trophy in three consecutive years (2004, 2005 and 2006). He also won his second Scudetto with Inter following the Calciopoli scandal which saw Juventus stripped of the 2006 title and it being awarded to Inter. However, he was not always chosen to start for the team and the arrival of Fabio Grosso after the World Cup meant that he was deemed surplus to the squad and as a result, did not have his contract renewed at the end of the 2006 season.
He was then subsequently signed by A.C. Milan on a free transfer, as a replacement for his former Lazio team-mate Giuseppe Pancaro, but once again, with players such as Kakha Kaladze and Paolo Maldini ahead of him in the ranks playing left-back, he would spend the seasons mainly on the bench. In the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final he appeared as a substitute late in the game which saw Milan gain their seventh European Cup in a 2–1 win over Liverpool F.C.. He was affectionately nicknamed Favallinho by Milan supporters after he scored his only two goals of the 2006–07 Serie A campaign in back-to-back wins over Empoli and Messina in April 2007. Towards the end of his career he was used as a centre-back by the Rossoneri.
On 1 July 2010, he was released by Milan at the age of 38 and retired thereafter.
He has represented Italy at under-18 level, as well winning the 1992 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship and playing at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.
He has earned 8 full caps between 1994 and 2004, and he was part of the Italy squad at Euro 2004 but made only one appearance replacing Gennaro Gattuso in the 76th minute in a 1–1 draw with Sweden. Italy performed poorly and, surprisingly, exited at the group stage, Sweden and Denmark qualified for the quarter-finals at their expense.
