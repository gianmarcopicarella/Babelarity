4450 Pan, provisional designation 1987 SY, is a highly eccentric, contact-binary asteroid, classified as a near-Earth and potentially hazardous object. It belongs to the group of Apollo asteroids and measures about 1.1 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 25 September 1987, by American astronomers Eugene and Carolyn Shoemaker at the U.S Palomar Observatory in California.
The stony S-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.6–2.3 AU once every 633 days (1 year and 9 months). Its orbit is tilted by 6 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic and shows an exceptionally high eccentricity of 0.59. In 2013, a photometric light-curve analysis at the U.S. Palmer Divide Station in Colorado rendered a relatively long rotation period of 7001564800000000000♠56.48±0.02 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.64 in magnitude, superseding two less accurate observations. The asteroid's surface has an assumed albedo of 0.20, which is typical for bodies of stony composition. As an Apollo asteroid, it is an Earth-crosser and has a minimum orbit intersection distance with Earth of 0.0285 AU. In addition, due to its extremely eccentric orbit, it is also a Venus- and Mars-crosser and approaches Mercury within 20 Gm.
The asteroid is a contact binary, composed of two lobes in mutual contact, held together only by their weak gravitational attraction, and typically show a dumbbell-like shape (also see 4769 Castalia). A large number of near-Earth objects are believe to be contact binaries.
The minor planet was named after the Greek god of nature and wild animals, Pan, represented in art as a horned half-man, half goat. He developed from a shepherd god into a hunter, fisherman and warrior, and was worshiped by the citizens of Athens, after he had spread panic through the invading Persian armies in the Battle of Marathon (also see 4356 Marathon). The name Pan has also been given to Saturn XVIII, one of the moons of Saturn.
