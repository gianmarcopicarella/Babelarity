The first settlers of Guarne were Tahamíes Indians who came from the Nare River. In 1541, Alvaro Mendoza entered the Guarne area, but finding no gold, returned to the Aburrá Valley. In 1640, searching for gold, Captain Fernando del Toro Zapata and Diego Beltran del Castillo arrived at Guarne. The first non-Amerindian settlers of the area of Guarne were slaves. In 1757, Guarne became part of Rionegro, and in 1814, Juan del Corral created the Guarne Township.
