Bosson (born Staffan Olsson on 21 February 1969) is a Swedish singer-songwriter. He first gained nationwide fame in Sweden when he imitated Michael Jackson in the first season of Sikta mot stjärnorna, performing "Black or White" and winning his semi-final. His big break as a solo artist came when composing and performing the song "One in a Million" from the album One in a Million which became a Top 10 hit in Europe and Asia in 2000 and 2001, which also appeared in the movie Miss Congeniality. He wrote it to his then girlfriend Jessica Olérs, Miss Sweden 1998, and was nominated for a Golden Globe.
Two years later the successful follow-up Rockstar was released, and in June 2007 he released his fourth album Future's Gone Tomorrow / Life Is Here Today and in June 2013 he released his fifth album Best Of 11-Twelve. He served as an opening act for Britney Spears during her tour in 2000, and has toured with Kylie Minogue. He has also written songs for Amy Grant and the famous guitarist Al Di Meola. As well as in his native Sweden, Bosson has achieved huge success and toured extensively in countries like Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. He also performed with Dima Bilan.
His stage name comes from the fact that his father's first name is Bo - hence he is Bo's son.
