Margaux is a commune in the Gironde department in Aquitaine in southwestern France.
The village lies in the Haut Médoc wine making region on the left bank of the Garonne estuary, northwest of the city of Bordeaux.
Margaux is the name of the wine appellation d'origine, Margaux AOC, that encompasses the village and the neighbouring villages of Arsac, Labarde, Soussans and Cantenac, and is the most southerly of Médoc's appellations. The commune makes almost entirely red wine.
The 1855 classification contained more wines from Margaux than from any other appellation, and its best-known vineyard, Château Margaux, was one of only four wines to be awarded the Premier Cru status.
The singer-songwriter and oenologist Al Stewart released an album of songs involving wine in 2000 called Down in the Cellar, of which one track is entitled "Waiting for Margaux."
In the movie Withnail & I, the character Uncle Monty brings a bottle of '53 Margaux ("best of the century") to the cottage in the country.
In the 2009 movie Sherlock Holmes, Holmes (Robert Downey_Jr) refers to a Margaux 1858 and expresses fascination that an astronomical event can affect the quality of the harvest, referring to the 1858 Margaux being a comet vintage.
