The national flag of the Republic of Chad (French: Drapeau du Tchad, Arabic: علم تشاد‎‎) is a vertical tricolor consisting (left to right) of a blue, a yellow and a red field. Blue was substituted for green to avoid confusion with Mali. The basic design is the same as that of the flag of Romania, the flag of Andorra, and the flag of Moldova. The only divergence from the flag of Romania is different variations of blue on the left strip.
Blue symbolizes, officially, the sky, hope, and water; yellow the sun and the desert to the north of the country; red progress, unity, and sacrifice. Red also recalls the blood shed for independence. RGB colours values are, respectively, 12-28-140, 252-209-22 and 206-17-38.
The flag was adopted by law #59/13 for the autonomous republic and retained on independence in 1960, and in the constitution of 1962. Despite many political upheavals within Chad since independence, the flag has not been changed. This may be because the flag is not associated with any of the main power rivals within Chad, which had no sense of national identity before independence, and little after independence.
The flag of Chad is almost identical to Romania's flag, but with a darker tint of blue.
