Mamuju is the capital of the Indonesian province of West Sulawesi. The city was formerly part of South Sulawesi province.
Education in Mamuju extends up to SMA III (Year 12) and people from surrounding areas (especially the area of Kalumpang) will travel to Mamuju to further their education. For students that wish to pursue a tertiary education must travel to larger towns like Makassar.
Agriculture in this area includes jackfruit, rambutan, durian, rice, and bananas.
Like many places in West Sulawesi, Mamuju is a predominantly Muslim city, with many mosques. However, Christianity has established a presence with several churches in this town. Buddhism is an extremely small contingent of the peoples faith and Hinduism is realistically a blend of adat and Islam.
