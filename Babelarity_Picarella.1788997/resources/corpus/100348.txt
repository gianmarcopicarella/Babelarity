Moscovici deeply involved himself in the controversy over the Greek Bail-out, regularly expressing sympathy for the Greek predicament, but adhering to the need for internal devaluation largely achieved by cutting wages and pensions and thus causing a severe depression which, in turn meant that Greece's tax revenues largely disappeared. He then promoted the deal which the Troika tried to force on Greece and criticized the Greek negotiators for refusing to agree, while pretending that a sustainable proposal was on the table.
"We sincerely hope that Greece remains in the eurozone", Moscovici said.
