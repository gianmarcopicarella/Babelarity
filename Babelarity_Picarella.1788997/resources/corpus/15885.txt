Timo Scheider (born 10 November 1978 in Lahnstein) is a German racing driver who competes in the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters for Audi. He won the title in 2008 and 2009.
Like most other drivers, Scheider started his racing career in karting in 1989. In 1992, he went on to win the Kerpen Winter Cup and earned seventh place in the German Junior Kart NRW-Cup a year later. His seventh place disappointment led to success the next year when he won the cup.
In 1995, Scheider joined the German Formula Renault 1800 championship and won it in his first year. The next year, he jumped to the 2000 championship and earned fourth place.
After only two years in Formula Renault, the German moved to Formula Three in 1997, in the German series. He clinched second place behind Nick Heidfeld in 1997 with three wins but his performance deteriorated the next year when he finished seventh, despite three victories. In 1999 he finished sixth, bringing an end to his rise through the single-seater ranks.
Scheider spent the next five years of his racing career in DTM for Opel. In his first year in 2000, he finished twelfth followed by a disappointing 19th the next year. He improved to finish eighth in 2002. The following year he finished eighth again and scored a pole position. He also finished in first place at the 24 Hours Nürburgring. In 2004, Scheider retained his eighth place in DTM and was tenth in the 24 Hours of Nürburgring.
Scheider left the DTM in 2005, which became a busy year for Scheider. He joined Vitaphone Racing in the FIA GT Championship, where he finished second. He won the Spa 24 Hours and also at Istanbul. He was 13th overall and class winner in the Nürburgring 24 Hours. He was also selected for A1 Team Germany that year.
After one year away, Scheider returned to the DTM in 2006 with Audi Sport Team Rosberg, finishing the season in 10th place. In 2007 he joined the works Audi team, Abt Sportsline, finally taking his first podium finish as he finished seventh overall.
2008 showed great improvement from Scheider winning three races as he won the 2008 DTM Championship, finishing four points ahead of Paul di Resta of Mercedes-Benz. In 2009 he repeated his title success for Audi, beating closest rival Gary Paffett by five points over the ten rounds, taking two victories.
