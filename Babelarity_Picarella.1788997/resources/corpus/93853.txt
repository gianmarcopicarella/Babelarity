Hartlaub's bustard (Lissotis hartlaubii) is a species of bird in the Otididae family. Some authorities (such as Birdlife International 2004) place it in the genus Eupodotis.
It is found in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda.
The common name and Latin binomial commemorate the German physician and ornithologist Gustav Hartlaub.
