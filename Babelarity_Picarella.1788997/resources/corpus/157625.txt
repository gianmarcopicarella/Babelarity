San Juan County has not supported a Democrat for president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1936. However the county is slightly more competitive at the state level due to its high Native American population, comparatively small Mormon population as well its economic distress. Notably, San Juan voted for the Democratic candidates in the 1988 and 2000 gubernatorial elections, both of which Republicans won. The area also votes less Republican than the rest of Utah in national elections. In 2004, for example, George W. Bush won 60.02% in San Juan County versus 71.54% in the state as a whole.
Through the mechanism of putting nearly all Navajo voters in one district the San Juan County Board of Commissioners was controlled by white Mormons for many years. However, in 2016, a Federal District Court decision branded the practice “racial gerrymandering” and found it violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the U.S. Constitution to rely on race to draw the boundaries of its voting districts.
