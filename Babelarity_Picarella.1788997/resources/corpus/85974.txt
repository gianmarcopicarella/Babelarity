Harira (Arabic:حريرة) is a Moroccan traditional soup. It is popular as a starter but is also eaten on its own as a light snack. It is mostly served during Ramadan, although made throughout the year in Morocco.
The word Harira (Arabic:حريرة) is derived from the arabic word "Harir" (Arabic:حرير) meaning silky because of it's consistancy.
Harira's base-recipe is composed of the following ingredients, and may vary depending on regions in Morocco:
Tadouira - a thickening mixture made from flour and water and sometimes canned tomato paste, which is added to the end of the harira cooking process
tomatoes and tomato concentrate
lentils
chickpeas
onions
rice
beaten eggs
herbs (celery, parsley and coriander)
spices (mainly saffron, ginger, and pepper)
small amount of meat: (beef, lamb or chicken)
a spoon or two of olive oil.
Lemon juice can also be added at serving time as well as salt and turmeric.
It is usually served with hard-boiled eggs sprinkled with salt and cumin, dates and other favorite dried fruits like figs, traditional honey sweets and other home-made special breads or crepes. It is served with Moroccan chebakia or dates or bread or some slices of lemon
