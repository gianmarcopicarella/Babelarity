Nine Mile is a village in Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica, a few miles south of Brown's Town. On February 6, 1945 the Reggae musician and peace activist Bob Marley was born there, and later buried there.
The Bob Marley Mausoleum is a tourist attraction located in Nine Mile, managed by members of Marley’s family. It has many historical artifacts including guitars, awards and photographs. Nine Mile is where Bob Marley’s musical career began and also influenced many of his songs.
There is a Rasta-colored ‘rock pillow’ on which Marley laid his head when seeking inspiration. His body lies buried along with his guitar in a 2.5 m-tall (8.2 ft) oblong marble mausoleum inside a small church of traditional Ethiopian design.  There are two mausoleums on the property. The first entered is Mama Marley’s. The second entombs Marley.
