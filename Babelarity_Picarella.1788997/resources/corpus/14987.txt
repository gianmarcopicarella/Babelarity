Mariya Vasiliyevna Abakumova (Russian: Мария Васильевна Абакумова) (born 15 January 1986 in Stavropol) is a Russian javelin thrower. She won the gold medal at 2011 World Championships in Athletics in Daegu, South Korea where she threw a Russian national and World Championships record of 71.99 metres. She also won the Olympic silver medal in 2008. She competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics and came in 10th place not breaking 60m. In 2013 she won the Universiade in Kazan, Russia with a result of 65.12m and later this year she was 3rd at the World Championships in Moscow with 65.09m.
In May 2016, it was reported that Abakumova was one of 14 Russian athletes, and nine medalists, implicated in doping following the retesting of urine from the 2008 Olympic Games. Abakumova was named by Russian press agency TASS as having failed the retest, which was undertaken following the Russian doping scandal of 2015 and 2016. If confirmed, under IOC and IAAF rules, Abakumova stands to lose all results, medals and records from the date of the original test to May 2016.
