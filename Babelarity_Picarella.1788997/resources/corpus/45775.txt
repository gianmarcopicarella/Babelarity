Nikola Šarčević (Serbian Cyrillic: Никола Шарчевић; born 9 July 1974, Örebro) is a Swedish musician of Serbian origin. He is the bassist, vocalist, and primary songwriter for the Swedish punk rock band Millencolin. He lives in Gothenburg with his wife Lisa, and three daughters.
Lock-Sport-Krock was Šarčević's first solo album. The title comes from the name of an imaginary football team that he and his brother pretended to play in when they were young. His solo work is mostly composed of Folk Rock and Country Music. On 20 April 2003, the band cancelled their US Tour after Nikola reported the disappearance of his brother, Miodrag Šarčević. Miodrag was never found.
Nikola was listed as one of the "World's Sexiest Vegetarians" in 2008 and 2009, despite the fact that Nikola claims he is not a vegetarian. Šarčević's second solo album, Roll Roll and Flee, was released on 23 October 2006.
On 2 December 2009, Šarčević announced on his official Facebook page that he would release his third solo record "Nikola & Fattiglapparna" in 2010. The 11-song album was his first release to be recorded entirely in Swedish. In 2010 it was released through his own label Stalemate Music.
