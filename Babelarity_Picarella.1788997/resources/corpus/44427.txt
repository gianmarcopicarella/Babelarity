Mark Jansen, (born 15 December 1978 in Reuver, Netherlands), is a Dutch heavy metal musician.
As guitarist, Jansen founded After Forever with Sander Gommans, and was one of the main songwriters since their debut album Prison of Desire. He left After Forever in 2002, and after his departure the band took a new musical direction.
Jansen started a new symphonic metal band called Sahara Dust, which was later renamed Epica. His girlfriend at the time, Simone Simons, joined the band in 2003. In both After Forever and Epica, he has performed growled vocals, complementing the vocals of, respectively, Floor Jansen and Simone Simons.
In 2010, Jansen announced that he has formed another band called MaYaN. Unlike his other bands, Jansen sings but does not play guitar. The band released their debut album Quarterpast in spring 2011.
Jansen has a masters degree in psychology.
