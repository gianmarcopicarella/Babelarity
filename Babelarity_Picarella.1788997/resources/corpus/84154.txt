Statesboro is the largest city and county seat of Bulloch County, Georgia, United States, located in Southeast Georgia. A college town, Statesboro is best known as the home of Georgia Southern University, a Carnegie Doctoral-Research University.
As of 2015, the Statesboro Micropolitan Statistical Area, which consists of Bulloch County, had an estimated population of 72,651. The City itself had a population of 28,422 in the 2010 census. The City had an estimated 2015 population of 30,721.
The city was chartered in 1803, starting as a small trading community providing the basic essentials for surrounding plantations. In 1906, Statesboro leaders joined together to bid for and win the First District A&M School, which eventually grew into Georgia Southern University. Statesboro inspired the blues song "Statesboro Blues", written by Blind Willie McTell in the 1920s, and covered in a well-known version by The Allman Brothers Band.
In 1801, George Sibbald of Augusta donated a 9,301-acre (37.64 km2) tract for a centrally located county seat for the growing agricultural community of Bulloch County. It was developed for large cotton plantations, worked by slave labor. In December 1803, the Georgia legislature created the town of Statesborough. In 1866 the state legislature granted a permanent charter and changed the spelling of the name to its present form of Statesboro.
During the Civil War and General William T. Sherman's famous march to the sea, a Union officer asked a saloon proprietor for directions to Statesboro. The proprietor replied, "You are standing in the middle of town." The soldiers destroyed only the courthouse—a crude log structure that doubled as a barn when court was not in session. After the Civil War, the city began to grow and Statesboro emerged as a major town in southeastern Georgia.
Around the turn of the century, new stores and banks sprang up along the town's four major streets, each named Main. In 1908 Statesboro led the world in sales of long-staple Sea Island Cotton, a specialty of the Low Country. For each bale of cotton sold in Savannah, ten bales were sold in Statesboro. After the boll weevil decimated the cotton crop in the 1930s, farmers shifted to tobacco. By 1953 more than 20 million pounds of tobacco passed through warehouses in Statesboro, then the largest market of the "bright Tobacco Belt" spanning Georgia and Florida.
The 1906 First District Agricultural & Mechanical School at Statesboro changed to the 1924 Georgia Normal School, then became the South Georgia Teachers College in 1929, Georgia Teachers College in 1939, and Georgia Southern College in 1959. During the Cold War, the Statesboro Bomb Plot of the 12th RBS Squadron was a Strategic Air Command radar station for Radar Bomb Scoring.
