Ornbau is a walled city in the district of Ansbach, in Bavaria, Germany. It is situated on the river Altm√ºhl, 15 km southeast of Ansbach.
Ornbau is the smallest (population) city in the German state of Bavaria. Its designation as a city dates back to medieval times because a wall and a mote surround the city.
The wall and the cathedral church are approximately 1000 years old. The wall, the bridge, and the original steeple are still standing and in good condition. The town lies near the Roman town of Gunzenhausen. Gunzenhausen was an outpost on the Roman Limes Line, one of the largest structures ever constructed by mankind.
On the chimney of the "old schoolhouse" there are giant crane nests that have stood for centuries. They are a source of pride for the citizens of Ornbau.
Every year, an estimated 500 classic Mercedes-Benz cars from throughout Germany, and Europe gather in Ornbau in the largest mercedesbenzclubs.de gathering of the year. Thousands attend annually, and a fireworks display to rival that of many small us cities is shown.
