The flag of Djibouti (Somali: Calanka Jabuuti, Arabic: علم جيبوتي‎‎, French: Drapeau de Djibouti) was adopted on 27 June 1977, following the country's independence from France. The light blue represents the Issa Somalis, and the green represents the Afars. The red star represents the unity and blood shed by the martyrs of independence.
Before the establishment of French Somaliland, the flag of the Sultanate of Tajoura was the only ensign used in the territory. The flag of Djibouti was later created in 1972. Adopted in 1977, the national flag was an adaptation of the flag of the Ligue Populaire Africaine pour l'Independence (LPAI), a political party that led Djibouti to independence. The LPAI flag had a red triangle with a white star. For the national flag, the star was placed in an upright rather than a slanted position, and the proportions of the flag were lengthened. White, green, and light blue are the colors of the LPAI. The flag of Djibouti was raised for the first time upon independence on 27 June 1977, by the head of police Yacine Yabeh Galab. It is today flown on many governmental buildings.
The flag of Djibouti features two equal horizontal bands of blue (top) and green, with a white isosceles triangle based on the hoist side. The triangle bears a red star in its centre, which represents unity and blood. Each colour symbolizes something different; namely, the earth (green), the sea and sky (light blue), peace (white), and unity (red). The light blue represents the Issa Somalis, and the green represents the Afar. The red star signifies the unity of the state.
