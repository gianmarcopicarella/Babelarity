Christian Corrêa Dionisio (born 23 April 1975), known simply as Christian, is a Brazilian retired footballer who played as a striker.
Born in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Christian began his career with hometown's Sport Club Internacional, and moved at just 17 to Portuguese club C.S. Marítimo, representing another two modest teams in the country in the following two seasons but always in the Primeira Liga.
In 1996 he returned to Internacional, where his performances eventually awarded him a callup to the Brazilian national team, and he was eventually part of the 1999 Copa América-winning squad – 17 minutes against Chile in the group stage (1–0 win) and ten against Argentina in the quarterfinals (2–1) – eventually signing with Paris Saint-Germain FC.
In the French capital side, however, Christian failed to perform, also being loaned to two clubs before being released in June 2003. During his two-year loan spell at Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense the team narrowly avoided relegation to the Série B in his first year, but it befell in the following.
Subsequently Christian represented Omiya Ardija, São Paulo FC, Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas, Esporte Clube Juventude and Sport Club Corinthians Paulista, returning to Internacional in early 2007. The following year he joined Associação Portuguesa de Desportos, then moved to Mexico's C.F. Pachuca, switching back to Portuguesa shortly after, with the club now in the second level.
