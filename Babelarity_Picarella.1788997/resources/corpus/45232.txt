Inside of Emptiness is the sixth studio album by John Frusciante, released on October 26, 2004 on Record Collection, and is the fourth in a series of six releases, issued from June 2004 to February 2005. The album features contributions from Josh Klinghoffer and Omar Rodríguez-López.
Frusciante notes, "It's really powerful, but in a gentle way. There's a soothing quality. It has hard things on it, and even the soft things have a heaviness to them. The song "Scratches" is emotionally heavy to me, even though it's not distorted guitars and bashing drums. There's another song about a couple's baby dying. There's a lot of spontaneity and recklessness and not giving a fuck."
The vinyl edition of the record saw a repressing from Record Collection on December 11, 2012. These reissued records are 180 gram and come with a download of choice between MP3 and WAV formats of the album.
