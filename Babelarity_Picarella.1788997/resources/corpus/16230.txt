The 1986 Davis Cup (also known as the 1986 Davis Cup by NEC for sponsorship reasons) was the 75th edition of the most important tournament between national teams in men's tennis. The Africa Zone was added for this year, effectively as a qualifying tournament for the European Zones. 71 teams would enter the competition, 16 in the World Group, 33 in the European Zone (including 9 in the Africa Zone), 13 in the Eastern Zone, and 9 in the American Zone. Australia defeated the defending champions, Sweden in the final, which was held at Kooyong Stadium in Melbourne, Australia, on 26–28 December.
First round losers play in World Group Relegation Play-off.
Date: 3–5 October
India, Paraguay, Spain, and West Germany remain in World Group in 1987.

For the 1986 edition of the Davis Cup, a new African sub-zone was added to allocate two places in the two main European brackets that granted spots on the 1987 World Group.
