The Sweden men's national handball team (Swedish: Sveriges herrlandslag i handboll) is the national handball team of Sweden and is controlled by the Swedish Handball Association. Its most successful periods were under coaches Curt Wadmark (1948-1967) and Bengt Johansson (1988–2004). The team under Bengt Johansson, nicknamed Bengan Boys in Sweden, is regarded as one of the finest national teams in the history of the sport with players like Tomas Svensson, Magnus Wislander and Stefan Lövgren. From 1990 through 2002 the team reached the medal round in every championship (6 World Championships, 5 European Championships and 3 Olympic Games, earning 13 medals in total) and qualified for a record 8 championship finals in a row 1996-2002.
Sweden is the most successful nation at the European Men's Handball Championship with 4 gold medals, and has won the most medals in the history of the World Men's Handball Championship with a total tally of 4 gold, 3 silver and 4 bronze medals. Sweden holds the European records for most medals in international competition (19 medals) as well as reaching the most medal rounds (22 tournaments). Conversely, Sweden has yet to win an Olympic title despite participating in 4 finals (Sweden participated in the 1952 Summer Olympics in a handball demonstration match, defeating Denmark 19-11). The team has also won the World Cup 3 times, the Super Cup 2 times, and were Intercontinental Cup winners in 2000.
