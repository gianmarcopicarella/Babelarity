Mount Muhabura, also known as Mount Muhavura, is an extinct volcano in the Virunga Mountains on the border between Rwanda and Uganda. At 4,127 m, Muhabura is the third highest of the eight major mountains of the mountain range, which is a part of the Albertine Rift, the western branch of the East African Rift. Muhabura lies partly in Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda and partly in Mgahinga Gorilla National Park, Uganda.
The name Muhabura means The Guide in the local language, Kinyarwanda, which probably derives from a historical use of the mountain to aid navigation. It can be seen from many parts of Uganda and Rwanda because of its slope.
