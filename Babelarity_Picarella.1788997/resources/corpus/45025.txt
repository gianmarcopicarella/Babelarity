Can't Take Me Home is the debut album by singer P!nk, released in the United States on April 4, 2000 by LaFace Records. It produced three singles—"There You Go", "Most Girls", and "You Make Me Sick", and peaked at number twenty-six on the U.S. Billboard 200. Producers included Kevin "She'kspere" Briggs, Babyface, Kandi Burruss, Terence "Tramp Baby" Abney, Daryl Simmons, and Tricky. Pink shared co-writing credit on seven of the album's tracks. This album featured a contemporary R&B sound; Pink transitioned to a more pop-rock oriented sound on her follow-up albums. She later went on to admit that during the period of promoting this album she felt stifled, as it was not reflective of her true musical ambitions.
