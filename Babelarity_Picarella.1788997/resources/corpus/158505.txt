The black-shanked douc (Pygathrix nigripes) is an endangered species of douc found in forests of Vietnam and Cambodia. This species is unique among the doucs in having a largely greyish-blue face. A recent report by the Wildlife Conservation Society estimated that approximately 42,000 black-shanked doucs were present in Cambodia's Seima Biodiversity Conservation Area and recently was also recorded in Lumphat Wildlife Sanctuary by BirdLife International Cambodia Programme. Prior to the recent discovery in the Seima Biodiversity Conservation Area, the largest known populations were believed to be in adjacent Vietnam, where the black-shanked douc population hovers at 600. The total population of the species remains unknown.
