Wayne was first settled in the 1820s. Soon a hamlet began to develop known as Derby’s Corners. In 1836 the name of the settlement was changed to Wayne in honor of General Anthony Wayne. In 1869 Wayne was incorporated as a village. Its population and industrial production significantly increased after World War II.
Wayne's population was 19,899 in 1990, more than its 2000 population.
On December 29, 2010, according to an Associated Press news story featured on the AOL News homepage, a family-owned furniture store (located in downtown Wayne about 15 miles southwest of Detroit) exploded and collapsed in what authorities believed to be a natural gas explosion, critically injuring the store's owner, Paul Franks (who was listed in serious condition in the burn unit of the University of Michigan Hospital in Ann Arbor), and trapping two others beneath the rubble, after a failed attempt by area police to locate them using their cellular phones. Later, Wayne City Manager John Zech said rescuers using search dogs found the body of salesman James Zell, 64, of Westland, in the debris left by the explosion at the store. At some point afterwards, Shawn Bell, Wayne's deputy fire marshal, said that workers found the body of a woman in the rubble, and that she was a clerical worker for the store in her fifties, who was also from Westland. Police and fire officials, who said that it would be highly unlikely for anyone else to have survived under the concrete, had evacuated nearby homes and businesses, where the power had been fluctuating. The blast, which left a heavy scent of natural gas, was likened by one witness to a bombing; it broke nearby windows and could be felt miles away.

The two-story building was constructed in 1878 and officially became the Wayne Historical Museum. In July 1963, the City Council adopted the Historical Ordinance that created the Historical Commission, which oversees the collection and preservation of Wayne's History.
On March 19, 1985, the City Council approved the site plan recommended by the Historical Commission for the expansion and renovation of the historical Museum. The money to fund this project was a result of Historical Fund Requests by Floyd Warner, Clara Hosie and Mr. and Mrs. Peter E. Brender. The new addition, dedicated to the public on September 4, 1986, did not cost the taxpayers any money. The State of Michigan Historical Marker was dedicated to the public October 25, 1987.
