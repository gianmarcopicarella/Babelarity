Braham is the homemade pie capital of Minnesota. Every year on the first Friday in August, the people of Braham celebrate Pie Day. This celebration includes craft sales, music, food stands, games, and entertainment, and various types of pie.
Braham was declared the Pie Capital of Minnesota by former Governor Rudy Perpich in 1990. Braham became famous for its pie in the 1930s and 1940s when Minnesotans would take the "shortcut to Duluth through Braham." While taking this "shortcut," people would stop in Braham and visit the Park Cafe, the cafe that made Braham pie famous. Pie Day began in July 1990, after Independence Day, as an ice-cream social for fundraising and other charitable activities. The date was changed to the first Friday in August when the Isanti County Historical Society took charge of the event in 1992.
