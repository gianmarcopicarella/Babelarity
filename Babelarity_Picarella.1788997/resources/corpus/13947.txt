The Duo Normand is a two-man team time trial (against the clock) for elite racing cyclists. Held annually in Normandy, France, it was instituted in 1982. Launched by a local cycling association, the Duo Normand takes place on a road circuit of more than 54 km (34 mi) every September. The first three editions were for amateurs only; professionals were admitted from the fourth edition, in 1985.
