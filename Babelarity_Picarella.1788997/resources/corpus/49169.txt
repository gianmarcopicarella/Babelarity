The dinar was the currency of Croatia between December 23, 1991, and May 30, 1994. The ISO 4217 code was HRD.
The Croatian dinar replaced the 1990 version of Yugoslav dinar at par. It was a transitional currency introduced following Croatia's declaration of independence. During its existence the dinar declined in value by a factor of about 70. The dinar was replaced by the kuna at a rate of 1 kuna = 1000 dinara. The currency was not used in the Republic of Serbian Krajina.
The obverse of all banknotes was the same, with a picture of Croatian Dubrovnik scientist Ruđer Bošković. Notes up to 1000 dinara had the Zagreb cathedral on reverse. The higher denominations featured the Ivan Meštrović sculpture History of the Croats on the reverse.
