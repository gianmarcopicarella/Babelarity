Madonna di Campiglio (German: Sankt Maria im Pein) is a village and a ski resort in northeast Italy. It is a frazione of the comune of Pinzolo. The village lies in the Val Rendena at an elevation of 1,522 m (4,993 ft) above sea level, and has approximately 1,000 inhabitants.
The ski area around Madonna has 57 lifts and 150 km (93 mi) of ski runs, with a capacity of more than 31,000 people per hour, rises to 2,600 m (8,530 ft), has 50,000 m2 (12 acres) of snow park, 40 km (25 mi) for Nordic skiing and links to the pistes in Pinzolo, Folgarida, and Marilleva.
Madonna is the main point of access to the Brenta Dolomites, with its famous via ferrata, with the ski lift to the Passo Groste taking one directly to the northern end of the via ferrata network.
The village regularly hosts World Cup alpine skiing and snowboarding races. The Scuderia Ferrari Formula One and Ducati Corse MotoGP teams hold a media event in January at the resort. In summer the village hosts the Rally Stella Alpina, an Italian classic race. In cycling, the village has been the location for the finish of stages of the Giro d'Italia twice: in 1999 Marco Pantani won the stage whilst wearing the pink jersey, before being disqualified from the race after a blood test revealed a high haematocrit level, whilst in 2015 the stage was won by Mikel Landa.
