The Iranian Super League (ISL) is a professional volleyball league in Iran at the top of the Iranian volleyball league system. It was founded in 1975 as the Pasargard Cup, but after the Iranian Revolution it was renamed to the first Division. In 1997 the league system was revamped and the Iranian Super League was established. Paykan Tehran has won the most titles in the new Super League with 12 titles.
The first season of a national Iranian volleyball league was held in 1975 with 12 teams competing. In 1976 Esteghlal became the champions for the first time, and they repeated this feat in the following season. In 1979 due to the Iranian Revolution the league was cancelled.
In 1989, the first Hazfi Cup for Iranian volleyball teams was held, in which Esteghlal became the first champions. During this period there was no national league and teams competed in the provincial and local leagues instead.
Shortly after the Hazfi Cup, in 1990 the national volleyball league of Iran was restarted by the Iranian Volleyball Federation with 10 teams competing and was called the Fajr Cup. In 2010 the format of the league was changed and 12 teams competed in the league, which was later increased to 14 shortly after and the name was also changed to the Iranian Volleyball Super League or the Iranian Volleyball Premier League.
