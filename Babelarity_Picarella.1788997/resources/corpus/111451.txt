Henry I (946–1002), called the Great, was Count of Nevers and Duke of Burgundy from 965 to his death. He is sometimes known as Odo-Henry or Otto-Henry (in French Eudes-Henri), since his birth name was "Odo" and he only adopted "Henry" on being elected duke of Burgundy.
He was a younger son of Hugh the Great, Count of Paris, and Hedwig of Saxony and thus the younger brother of King Hugh Capet. As Odo, he entered the church at a young age and was a cleric at the time of the death of his brother Otto, Duke of Burgundy, on 22 February 965. He was elected by the Burgundian counts to succeed his brother and they gave him the name Henry. However Otto-Henry only held three counties of his own, his vassals holding the remaining six that comprised the core of that held by Richard the Justiciar who died in 921.
In 972, he married Gerberga of Mâcon, the widow of Adalbert II of Italy, who had sought refuge at Autun. Through Gerberga, he had a stepson named Otto William. He married a second time to Gersenda, daughter of William II of Gascony. He died without any sons of his own by his first two wives and was succeeded by his stepson, Otto-William. The resulting war of succession between the adherents of Otto-William and those of Robert II of France, the latter finally prevailing.
By his third wife, Mathilde of Chalon he had a daughter:
Aramburga (born 999), married Dalmas de Sémur.
