The wolffish, also known as sea wolves, are a family, Anarhichadidae, of perciform fish. They are native to cold waters of the northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, where they live on the continental shelf and slope, to depths of about 600 m (2,000 ft). They are bottom-feeders, eating hard-shelled invertebrates such as clams, echinoderms, and crustaceans, which they crush with their strong canine and molar teeth. The longest species, Anarrhichthys ocellatus, grows to more than 2 m (6.6 ft) in length.
The five species in two genera are:
Genus Anarhichas
Northern wolffish, Anarhichas denticulatus Kr√∏yer, 1845.
Atlantic wolffish or sea wolf, Anarhichas lupus Linnaeus, 1758.
Spotted wolffish, Anarhichas minor Olafsen, 1772.
Bering wolffish, Anarhichas orientalis Pallas, 1814.
Genus Anarrhichthys
Wolf eel, Anarrhichthys ocellatus Ayres, 1855.
