Ebert William Amâncio or simply Betão (born November 11, 1983 in São Paulo), is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a central defender for French club Evian and can also play on the right side of the back four. Betão is known for his positioning, aerial ability, strength and coverage of the opposing players.
Amâncio began his career in Corinthians before signing a four-year contract with Sochaux for €1 million on 6 August 2007. On 14 August 2007, Sochaux decided to sell him, which led to Betão returning to Corinthians.
Betão's contract with Corinthians expired on December 31, 2007 and was offered a three-year renewal but declined. After 14 years playing for Corinthians and wearing the captain's armband during the 2007 season, Betão was released from Corinthians after being made the scapegoat of the team's relegation by the chairman at the time. On January 8, 2008, Betão trained with Santos and the following day, signed a three-year contract with the team.
Betão made his debut for Santos on January 16, 2008 in the Campeonato Paulista, where they lost 0–2 against Portuguesa. He scored his first goal on February 24, 2008 in the 4–1 victory over Ituano for the Campeonato Paulista 2008.
On 14 January 2015 Betão announced his return to Dynamo Kyiv signing a contract until the end of the season. After only making appearances in the Ukrainian Super Cup, he ended up winning the cup and the Ukrainian Premier League that season. In June 2015, the president of Dynamo Ihor Surkis has confirmed that the club has not renewed Betao's contract and have ended their cooperation with him.
On 3 July 2015, Betao has signed a 3-year contract with one of his former clubs Evian.
