Giuseppe Galderisi (born 22 March 1963) is an Italian football manager, and a former footballer who played as a striker.
On the club level, Galderisi played for Juventus (1980–83), Hellas Verona (1983–86, 1988–89), AC Milan (1986–87), Lazio (1987–88), and Padova (1989–95). He finished out his career in Major League Soccer, playing with the New England Revolution and the Tampa Bay Mutiny in 1996 and 1997; he was traded to Tampa midway through the first season and then back to New England a year later.
Galderisi, nicknamed Nanu (short) during his playing career, was capped ten times for Italy, and was part of his country's 1986 FIFA World Cup squad.
Galderisi started a coaching career in 2000 as Serie C2 club Gubbio's boss. He then served as coach in years later for other Serie C clubs, such as Cremonese and Giulianova. His coaching career experienced a sudden break in January 2004, when Galderisi suffered a heart attack. He fully recovered since then, and in 2005 he accepted an offer from Viterbese of Serie C2. In 2006–2007, he coached Avellino of Serie C1; after a very impressive first half of season ended in first place, he was fired on 18 April 2007 despite his team, then in second place, was still involved in the promotion run.
In January 2008, Galderisi was appointed at the helm of Serie C1 side Foggia, replacing Salvatore Campilongo. During his tenure, the satanelli's performances dramatically improved as they managed to make a comeback to the promotion playoff spots.
On July 2008 he was appointed as new manager of Lega Pro Prima Divisione side Pescara, replacing Franco Lerda, with the aim to win promotion to Serie B for the biancazzurri. However, during his tenure as head coach, Galderisi had to face with serious economic issues within the club; Pescara was ultimately declared out of business on December 2008 and the club control passed legally to a bankruptcy trustee appointed by the Court of Pescara. On February 2009 a new property emerged, with Delfino Pescara 1936 being constituted and taking over the club from the Court of Pescara. Results did not improve anyway, with Pescara struggling in the bottom part of the table, and Galderisi was dismissed from his coaching post on 23 March 2009, being replaced by another former Juventus and Italy international footballer, Antonello Cuccureddu.
In the season 2009–10 he coaches Arezzo and in that following Benevento.
On 25 October 2011 he signed a one-year deal with sleeping giants U.S. Triestina Calcio until the end of the season. The season turned out to be a particularly troubled one due to massive financial issues that ultimately led to many players' departures during the winter transfer market, no salaries being paid for most of the season, relegation and even the cancellation of the club from Italian football.
On July 2012 he was announced as new head coach of hometown club Salernitana, who were just promoted back into professionalism, but he left after getting only one point in three games.
Later in January 2014, he was named new head coach of Portuguese top flight strugglers S.C. Olhanense, a club owned by an Italian consortium and with a squad featuring several players formerly of Serie A. He left the club by the end of the season after failing to save it from relegation.
