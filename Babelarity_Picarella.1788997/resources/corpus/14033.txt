Jan Ingemar Stenmark (Swedish pronunciation: [ˈɪŋɛmar ˈsteːnmark]; born 18 March 1956 in Joesjö, Sweden) is a former World Cup alpine ski racer from Sweden. He is regarded as one of the most prominent Swedish sportsmen, and as the greatest slalom and giant slalom specialist of all time. He competed for Fjällvinden Tärnaby.
Born in Joesjö, Storuman Municipality, Lapland, Stenmark's family moved to Tärnaby near Norway when he was four years old. He became a childhood neighbor of Stig Strand (also born 1956), who tied Stenmark for the World Cup slalom title in 1983. Stenmark began skiing at the age of five and won his first national competition at age eight.
Stenmark made his World Cup debut in December 1973 at age 17. He won more international races than any other alpine skier in history; with 86 wins (46 giant slaloms and 40 slaloms) he is 10 ahead of Lindsey Vonn, who (as of February 6, 2016) has 76 wins. The closest male skier is Hermann Maier, with 54 victories to his name. Stenmark won only in the two technical disciplines: slalom and giant slalom (the other events are downhill, super-G, first run in December 1982, and combined). He rarely competed in the other disciplines, as he was not comfortable with speeds in excess of 120 km/h (75 mph). Stenmark has still the record for the biggest win-margin in an alpine race after winning with 4,06 seconds before 2nd placed Bojan Krizaj in Jasna, 4 February 1979. Stenmark was known as a quiet champion, with short, but polite, responses to media questions.
For his three straight World Cup titles (1976–78), Stenmark earned the Holmenkollen medal in 1979 (shared with Erik Håker and Raisa Smetanina). Stenmark also earned the Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal twice (1975, 1978). His 1978 medal was shared with tennis player Björn Borg, making them the only two men to ever win the honor twice (female alpine skier Anja Pärson received the medal in 2006 and 2007).
At the World Championships in 1978 in West Germany, Stenmark won the slalom by two-thirds of a second and the giant slalom by over two seconds, and successfully defended both world titles at the Winter Olympics in 1980 at Lake Placid, which were also world championships. At the next worlds in 1982 in Austria, he had a sub-standard first run in the giant slalom and was upset by American Steve Mahre and settled for silver. Stenmark rebounded in the slalom and became the first to win the same title in three consecutive world championships. At age 25, it was his final medal in a major competition.
Stenmark was not allowed to participate in the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo (a season in which he was the best giant slalom and second best slalom racer) by the International Ski Federation (FIS) for accepting promotional payments directly, rather than through the national ski federation. Hanni Wenzel of Liechtenstein was also banned; both were double gold medalists in 1980. Marc Girardelli, who was the best slalom racer during the 1983-84 season, wasn't allowed to participate either. In his case it was because he didn't have citizenship in Luxembourg, the country for which he competed. Stenmark was allowed back into the Olympic competition in 1988, but was past his prime and did not medal (however, he had the fastest second run of the slalom competition). He retired from World Cup competition at the end of the 1989 season in March, days before his 33rd birthday.
During the years from 1976 to 1978 Stenmark, along with tennis player Björn Borg, became a national icon in Sweden. This was not changed by the fact that he moved to Monaco in 1980 for tax reasons. At age 40, he won the Swedish Superstars championship in 1996. On 26 December 2004, Stenmark survived the Indian Ocean earthquake while on vacation in Thailand. In 2015, he was a celebrity dancer on the Let's Dance 2015, where he teamed up with professional dancer Cecilia Ehrling.
Stenmark married longtime girlfriend Ann Uvhagen, a Lufthansa airline hostess, in September 1984, and they have a daughter.
He is now, 2015, married to Tarja Olli from Jakobstad, Finland, and they also have a daughter.
19 titles - (3 overall, 8 GS, 8 SL)
86 wins - (46 GS, 40 SL), 155 podiums
From 1948 through 1980, the Winter Olympics were also the World Championships for alpine skiing.
