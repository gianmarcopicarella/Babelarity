Brewton is a city in Escambia County, Alabama, United States. At the 2010 census, the population was 5,408. The city is the county seat of Escambia County. Brewton is located in south central Alabama, just north of the Florida Panhandle. Brewton has been voted one of the 100 best small towns in America.
In May 1861, the city of Brewton began as a train station under Edmund Troupe Bruton. The settlement was originally known as Newport when barges made runs to and from Pensacola, Florida on Murder Creek and Burnt Corn Creek before the installation of rail.
During the Civil War rail lines were severed, and small lumber mills were damaged or destroyed. However, after the war those who returned or arrived rebuilt the Brewton economy, began a school, and established small businesses. Into the 1870s a new European demand for lumber opened the way for creation of numerous timber and lumber operations. The Conecuh-Escambia river system became a timber artery to the Gulf.
Brewton became a town on February 13, 1885 and later became the seat of Escambia County, Alabama.
Brewton was known in past times as "the richest little town in the South." Brewton's high per capita income was created by a small number of "timber barons," as they are remembered, who arrived at the end of the last century to cut pine and stayed to build extraordinary homes along Belleville and Evergreen avenues. These families include the McMillans and the Millers, many of whom still reside in the town.
Over time the county erected a series of courthouses. Brewton developed an education system that included public and private institutions, including Jefferson Davis Community College and T. R. Miller High School, named for Thomas Richard Miller, a local timber baron and town father who contributed money toward the building and opening of the school.
