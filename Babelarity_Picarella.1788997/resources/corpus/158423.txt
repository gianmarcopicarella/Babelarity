Mount Afadja is the highest mountain in Ghana, at an elevation of 885 metres (2,904 ft). The mountain is located in the Agumatsa Range near the villages of Liati Wote and Gbledi, in the Volta Region of Ghana at the border with Togo. 'Afadja' is the name of the mountain whereas 'to' in the Ewe dialect means mountain therefore it is called 'Afadjato' by the indigenes. The correct name would be 'Mount Afadja' as 'Mount Afadjato' will be a repetition of the 'Mountain.' There is a nearby peak in Togo, about 3 km to the northeast, sometimes called Aduadu, which is higher than Afadjato, at over 900 m. There is a belief among some that Aduadu is in fact the highest point in Ghana, although it is located in Togo.
The name of the mountain was derived from the Ewe word Avadzeto, meaning "at war with the bush." The name derives from the presence on the mountainside of a plant causing severe skin irritation.
The nearby Tagbo Falls and Wli Falls (the highest in West Africa) are also considered tourist attractions.
