Monreal (Basque: Elo) is a town and municipality located in the province and autonomous community of Navarre, northern Spain. It had a population of 295 in 2002. It lies on the old Aragonese pilgrim's road to Santiago de Compostela, a tributary path of the Way of St James.
In 1185 Berengaria of Navarre was given the fief of Monreal by her father Sancho VI of Navarre, possibly to enhance her status in view of her bethrothal to Richard I of England.
