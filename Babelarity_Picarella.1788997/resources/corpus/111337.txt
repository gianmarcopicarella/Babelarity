Anund Gårdske, was the king of Sweden around 1070 according to Adam of Bremen's Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum. According to this source, Anund came from Kievan Rus', presumably from Aldeigjuborg. Gårdske means that he came from Gardariki which was one of the Scandinavian names for Kievan Rus'. As a Christian he refused to sacrifice to the Norse gods at the Temple at Uppsala and was consequently deposed, in 1070.
A hypothesis suggests that Anund and Inge the Elder were the same person, as several sources mention Inge as a fervent Christian, and the Hervarar saga describes how Inge also was rejected for refusing to administer the blóts and that he was exiled in Västergötland.
