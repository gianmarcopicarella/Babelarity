The French Guiana national football team (French: sélection de Guyane de football) is the regional team of the French overseas department and region of French Guiana and is controlled by the Ligue de Football de Guyane, the local branch of Fédération Française de Football.
As an overseas department of the French Republic, it is not a member of FIFA. French Guiana is therefore not eligible to enter the World Cup, but Guianese being French citizens are eligible to play for the French national football team. Bernard Lama and Florent Malouda are two examples of Guianese players who have played for the French national team, the former winning the 1998 World Cup and the latter playing as a runner-up during the 2006 World Cup.
However, French Guiana is a member of CONCACAF and CFU, and thus eligible for all competitions organized by both. Indeed, according to the status of the FFF (article 34, paragraph 6): "[...]Under the control of related continental confederations, and with the agreement of the FFF, those leagues can organize international sport events at a regional level or set up teams in order to participate to them."
The following 25 players were called up to the squad for the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup Playoff series vs. Honduras.
