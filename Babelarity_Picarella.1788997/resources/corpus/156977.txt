The earliest settlers, Luke Kelly, his family and May Keyser, settled at Hanging Rock, along the Ohio River in 1796. Lawrence County was formed on December 20, 1816 from parts of Gallia and Scioto Counties, with the county seat being at Burlington. In 1851 the county seat was moved from Burlington to Ironton. A new court House was built at that time but it burned in 1857. The present Lawrence County Courthouse was built in 1908.
