Caudete (Spanish: Caudete) is a municipality in Albacete, Castile-La Mancha, Spain. It has a population of 10.163 (From INE 2015) and is located at 38°42′00″N 000°58′59″W.
In the later stages of the reconquista, Caudete was at the focus of tensions between Castile and Aragon, since James I of Aragon conquered it from the Moors though it should have been reserved to Castile under the treaties of Tudilén and Cazorla. There were ongoing disputes between Cuadete and nearby Villena over control of the Alhorines Valley, an important wheat-growing area.
Until the 19th century the dominant language in the municipality was Valencian Catalan with some aspects of Aragonese. Since then the region underwent linguistic substitution by Spanish (Castilian) similar to in the Valencian comarca Vega Baja del Segura. Today the principal language is Castilian Spanish with some Valencian words. Caudete is famous for its Moros y Cristianos festival in September.
