1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die is a musical reference book edited, first published in 2005 by Universe Publishing. It compiles writings and information on albums chosen by a panel of music critics to be the most important, influential, and best in popular music between the 1950s and the 2000s. The book was edited by Robert Dimery, a writer and editor who had previously worked for magazines such as Time Out and Vogue.
Each entry in the book's list of albums is accompanied by a short essay written by a music critic, along with pictures, quotes, and additional information (such as the album's running time and producer). Only albums consisting fully of original material by a particular artist were included, which meant that compilations by various artists, including film soundtracks, were also excluded.
The most recent edition consists of a list of albums released between 1955 and 2013, part of a series from Quintessence Editions Ltd. The book is arranged chronologically, starting with Frank Sinatra's In the Wee Small Hours and the most recent edition concluding with The Next Day by David Bowie.
In February 2006, Publishers Weekly called the book a "...bookshelf-busting testament to music geeks' mania for lists" and said it "...is about as comprehensive a 'best-of' as any sane person could want." They continued, "For music lovers, it doesn't get much better." The 2006 version had an average rating of 3.92 stars out of 5 on Amazon.com's social cataloging website Goodreads, with 860 ratings as of April 30, 2015. The same 2006 version had an average rating of 3.5 stars out of 5 on Amazon.com, with 55 reviews as of April 30, 2015.
Although most of the book's recommendations are rock and pop albums from the Western world, 1001 Albums also features selections from world music, rhythm and blues, blues, folk, hip hop, country, electronic music, and jazz. The rock and pop albums include such subgenres as punk rock, grindcore, heavy metal, alternative rock, progressive rock, easy listening, thrash metal, grunge and 1950s-style rock and roll. Classical and modern art music are excluded.

The cover was also changed, with an image of Blondie's Debbie Harry used in place of the images of Kraftwerk and a child wearing headphones that had previously been used in the EU and US respectively. The cover for the Brazilian and Spanish edition features the Sex Pistols' Sid Vicious, the cover for the Norwegian edition features Hank von Helvete of Turbonegro, the cover for the Finnish and the Swedish editions feature David Bowie, and the cover for the Polish edition features Mick Jagger and Keith Richards.
The 2011 hardcover edition and subsequent printings up until the sixth printing in 2014 featured the Andy Warhol-designed banana from The Velvet Underground & Nico on the cover, with the Brazilian reissue using Debbie Harry following a publisher poll. The 2013 paperback edition has the cover for Joy Division's debut studio album, Unknown Pleasures. The latest Brazilian cover features a still of The Beatles in A Hard Day's Night.
