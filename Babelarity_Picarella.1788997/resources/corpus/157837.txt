Palu is a chartered city (kota) on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, 1,650 kilometres (1,030 miles) northeast of Jakarta, at 0°54′S 119°50′E, at the mouth of Palu River. It is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi of a long, narrow bay. Because of its sheltered position between mountain ridges, the climate is unusually dry. At the 2010 Census Palu had a population of around 336,300, not including those living in neighbouring regencies.
The city was divided at 2010 into four districts (kecamatan), tabulated below with their 2010 Census population.
The town was part of the Dutch Empire until Indonesia won independence in 1945–49. The Dutch controleur's house survives as a testament of that era.
In April 1958 during the Permesta rebellion in North Sulawesi, the USA supported and supplied the rebels. Pilots from a CIA Taiwan-based front organisation, Civil Air Transport, flying CIA B-26 Invader aircraft, repeatedly bombed and machine-gunned targets in and around Palu; destroying vehicles, buildings, a bridge and a ship.
On 24 January 2005 at 04:10 (UTC+8), an earthquake with magnitude 6.2 Richter scale occurred in the city. According to the local meteorological office, the epicenter of the earthquake was around 1.249° S, 119.922° E, some 16 kilometres (10 miles) southeast of Palu at the depth of 30 kilometres (19 miles) of Bora Village's hot spring, Biromaru sub-district, Donggala Regency. Panic ensued as most people sought refuge in the highlands for fear of a repeat disaster like the tsunami as occurred in Aceh. The earthquake killed one person, injured four others, and destroyed 177 buildings.
On 31 December 2005 at about 07:35 (UTC +8) a bomb blast at a market at a stall selling pork killed eight people and injured 45 others. An improvised explosive device, described as a nail bomb or similar, detonated around 07:00 in a butcher's market mostly frequented by Christian Minahasa shopping for New Year's Eve celebrations, killing eight people and wounding another 53.
Palu is served by Mutiara Airport, which is located outside the city center.
