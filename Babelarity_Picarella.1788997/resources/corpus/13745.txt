Marcin Wasilewski (Polish pronunciation: [ˈmart͡ɕin vaɕiˈlɛfskʲi]; born 9 June 1980 in Kraków), commonly known as Wasyl, is a Polish defender currently playing for Leicester City. He previously played for R.S.C. Anderlecht.
Early in his career he played for Polish clubs Hutnik Kraków, Śląsk Wrocław, and Wisła Płock. In 2005, he moved to Amica Wronki which merged with Lech Poznań in 2006.
In January 2007 he was acquired by the Belgian side Anderlecht.
Wasilewski is a right back. Despite being a defensive player, Wasilewski often scores goals. During the 2008–09 season, he was Anderlecht's third most prolific goalscorer, tied with Guillaume Gillet at eight goals.
On 30 August 2009, Wasilewski suffered an open leg fracture in the 26th minute of the 1–1 Jupiler League draw between Anderlecht and Standard Liège when Liège's Axel Witsel made a challenge. Witsel was red carded for the offence. Wasilewski underwent corrective surgery for open fractures to both the tibia and fibula. Witsel was suspended for eight games by the Belgian FA over the incident, after an appeal.
After a long rehabilitation, Wasilewski made his return on 8 May 2010. Wasilewski celebrated his return to Anderlecht's first eleven with the opening goal of his side's 2–1 win at SV Zulte Waregem.
His drive to return was rewarded with a new contract until the summer of 2013, with the club talking about him as "a club monument, who had to deliver an inhuman battle".
Wasilewski and Witsel, now at Zenit St. Petersburg, met again on the field on 24 October 2012 in a UEFA Champions League group match. Wasilewski announced in advance that he will refuse to shake hands with Witsel before the game, with Anderlecht management accepting his decision. However, he ultimately changed his mind and accepted Witsel's hand, claiming that he didn't want to turn the atmosphere of the match into a personal duel. Zenit won the game 1–0.
On 14 September 2013, Marcin Wasilewski was reported to undergo a try out with Leicester City in the English Championship, in the hope of landing a contract. On 17 September Wasilewski was confirmed as signing for The Foxes on a one-year contract. He made his debut in a League Cup third round match against Derby County on 24 September, playing the entire match as Leicester won 2–1. On 30 November 2013, a coach-full of Anderlecht fans travelled to Leicester's King Power Stadium to support Marcin at his new club. There were emotional scenes after Marcin played a key role in City's 3–0 win over Millwall. Wasilewski established himself as a first-team regular as Leicester finished the season as Championship champions and secured their return to the Premier League. On 22 May 2014, Wasilewski extended his contract by a further year.
Wasilewski made his Premier League debut on 1 November 2014, in the 0-1 defeat against West Bromwich Albion, during which Wasilewski appeared to elbow opposing striker, Saido Berahino, however The FA cleared the defender. On 31 January 2015, Wasilewski scored his first goal in English football, heading in a late consolation goal in Leicester's 3-1, Premier League defeat to Manchester United which was also the second goal ever to be scored in the Premier League by a Polish footballer after Robert Warzycha had scored in the competition's opening weekend 22 and a half years earlier. On 4 June 2015 Wasilewski announced via his Instagram account he had signed a new one-year contract with Leicester City.
He made his first league appearance of the 2015-16 Premier League season on 19 December 2015 when he started in a 3-2 win over Everton. Wasilewski played only two league games before Leicester's Premier League trophy presentation on 7 May 2016, making him ineligible for a winner's medal (minimum five league games required). Nonetheless, due to teammate Robert Huth's suspension, Wasilewski played the full match against Everton that same day as Leicester won 3-1. On 14 June 2016, Wasilewski signed a one-year extension to his contract.
Wasilewski made his debut in a friendly match against Denmark in Copenhagen on 20 November 2002. Wasilewski was also part of the Poland squads for Euro 2008 and Euro 2012.
