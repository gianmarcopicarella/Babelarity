1906 Naef, provisional designation 1972 RC, is a stony vestoid asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, about 7 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Swiss astronomer Paul Wild at Zimmerwald Observatory near Bern, Switzerland, on 5 September 1972.
The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.1–2.7 AU once every 3 years and 8 months (1,335 days). Its orbit is tilted by 6 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic and shows an eccentricity of 0.14. It has a well-defined rotation period of 11.0 hours. According to observations by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer's NEOWISE mission, the body's surface has an albedo of 0.23, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a higher value of 0.40.
1906 Naef is a vestoid or V-type asteroid, with its spectral type comparable to that of the group's namesake, 4 Vesta. V-type asteroids are less common than the abundant S-type asteroids, but they are similar in their stony composition, except for their higher concentration of pyroxenes, an aluminium-rich silicate mineral.
The minor planet was named after Swiss banker Robert A. Naef (1907–1975) from Zürich, an ardent amateur astronomer, who produced the yearly observers almanac, Der Sternenhimmel, since 1940.
