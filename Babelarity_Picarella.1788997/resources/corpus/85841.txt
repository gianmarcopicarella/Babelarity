Cottage pie (made with minced beef) or shepherd's pie (made with minced lamb) is a meat pie with a crust of mashed potato.
The term cottage pie was in use by 1791, when the potato was being introduced as an edible crop affordable for the poor (cf. "cottage" meaning a modest dwelling for rural workers).
In early cookery books, the dish was a means of using leftover roasted meat of any kind, and the pie dish was lined with mashed potato as well as having a mashed potato crust on top.
The term "shepherd's pie" did not appear until 1877, and since then it is sometimes used synonymously with "cottage pie", regardless of whether the principal ingredient was beef or mutton. Ouside the United States, the term "shepherd's pie" is used when the meat is lamb.
A St. Stephen's Day pie is made using turkey and ham.
The Cumberland pie is a version with a layer of breadcrumb on top.
A similar English dish made with fish is a fish pie.
