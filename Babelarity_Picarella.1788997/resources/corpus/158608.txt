Papendrecht ( pronunciation ) is a town and municipality in the western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland, at the crossing of the River Beneden Merwede and the Noord River. The municipality had a population of 32,177 in 2014 and covers an area of 10.79 km2 (4.17 sq mi) of which 1.31 km2 (0.51 sq mi) is water.
Although Papendrecht is first mentioned in documents dating back to 1105, it remained a small settlement until the 1950s. In the 1960s its development accelerated and almost its entire area is now urbanized. It is, however, known for its 180-year-old linden tree by the river.
The aerospace company Fokker Technologies is headquartered in Papendrecht.
Papendrecht has two water taxi stops, one at the Beneden Merwede River, and one at the Noord River. Bus services are provided by Arriva.
