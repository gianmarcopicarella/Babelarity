The genus Fagopyrum is in the flowering plant family Polygonaceae.
Fagopyrum contains 15 to 16 species of plants, including two important crop plants, Buckwheat or Fagopyrum esculentum, and Tartary buckwheat or Fagopyrum tataricum. They have similar uses, and are classed as pseudocereals, because they are used in the same way as cereals but do not belong to the grass family Poaceae.
Within Fagopyrum, the cultivated species are in the Cymosum group, including Fagopyrum dibotrys or Perennial buckwheat (formerly Fagopyrum cymosum), Fagopyrum giganteum, and Fagopyrum homotropicum.
This genus has five-petaled flowers arranged in a compound raceme that produces laterally flowered cymose clusters.
