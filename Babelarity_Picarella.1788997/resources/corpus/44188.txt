Ember to Inferno is the debut album from American heavy metal band Trivium. It was released on October 14, 2003 on Lifeforce Records.
This album is the final release by the band with former bassist Brent Young. Frontman Matt Heafy was 17 years old when the album was written and recorded.
Corey Beaulieu toured in support of the album, but did not play on the album according to the re-release booklet.
The 2004 reissue of the album includes early versions of "The Deceived" and "Blinding Tears Will Break the Skies". Both songs were re-recorded for Ascendancy, with the latter appearing only on the 2006 special edition. "Demon" is taken from the Trivium "blue demo" EP.
"Inception the Bleeding Skies" is "A View of Burning Empires" played in reverse.
On December 2, 2014 it was announced by Matt Heafy on Twitter that Ember to Inferno will be re-released again with new artwork along with the band's early demo EPs.
