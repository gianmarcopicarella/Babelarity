On 6 June 2013, Fernandinho became Manchester City's first signing of the summer, for a fee of £34 million. He signed a four-year deal and is understood to have waived around £4 million owed to him by Shakhtar in order to complete the transfer as he was desperate to secure a move away from the Ukrainian club. During his time at Shakhtar Donetsk, the Brazilian wore the number 7 shirt, but due to Manchester City midfielder James Milner already occupying the number, Fernandinho had to choose another. In an interview with Manchester City, Fernandinho recalled a conversation with his son in which his son said 'My dad is the new number 25', and so Fernandinho subsequently chose 25 as his new number.
