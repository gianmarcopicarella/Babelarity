Namaka is the smaller, inner moon of the dwarf planet Haumea. It is named after NƒÅmaka, the goddess of the sea in Hawaiian mythology and one of the daughters of Haumea.
Namaka was discovered on 30 June 2005 and announced on 29 November 2005. It was nicknamed "Blitzen" by the discovery team being assigned an official name.
Namaka is only 1.5% as bright as its parent dwarf planet Haumea and is about 0.05% its mass. If it turns out to have a similar albedo, it would be about 170 km in diameter. Photometric observations indicate that its surface is made of water ice.
