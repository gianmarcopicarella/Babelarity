Born as son of Wincenty and Stanisława Łastowiecka in Lwów, Poland (now Lviv, Ukraine), Jaworski studied at the Lwów Major Seminary and was ordained in Kraków on 25 June 1950. He served as a priest for two years (1950–1952) before returning to school, obtaining three doctorates by 1965 – one in theology from the Jagiellonian University, and Ph.D.s from the Lublin Catholic University and Warsaw Theological Academy.
In 1970, he was made secretary of the Polish Bishops' Scientific Council from 1970 to 1984. He was Dean of the Pontifical Theological Faculty in Kraków from 1976 to 1981, and its Rector from 1981 to 1987.
Appointed apostolic administrator of Lviv for territories within Poland in May 1984, he was consecrated bishop on 23 June. He was made archbishop on 16 January 1991.
At the consistory of 21 February 1998, Jaworski was created Cardinal by John Paul II in pectore, one of four such secret cardinal appointments he made while pope; Jaworski's cardinalate was made public at the consistory of 21 February 2001. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. He reached 80 in 2006, losing the right to participate in future conclaves. On October 2008 the Pope accepted his resignation as archbishop.
