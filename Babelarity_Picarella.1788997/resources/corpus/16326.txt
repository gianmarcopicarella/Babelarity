Rogério Mücke Ceni (Brazilian Portuguese: [ʁoˈʒɛɾiu ˈsẽni]; born 22 January 1973) is a Brazilian former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper.
Most of his vast professional career, which had spanned 25 years, was associated with São Paulo FC, with which he won 20 major titles, including three Brazilian Leagues and two Libertadores Cup. He also scored more than 100 goals during his career, with all of them coming from free kicks and penalties, becoming the first and only player in his position to reach that milestone.
Recognized by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics as the goalkeeper to have scored the most goals in the history of football, surpassing José Luis Chilavert in 2006, Ceni represented Brazil at two World Cups.
Born in Pato Branco, Paraná, Ceni made his senior debuts with Sinop Futebol Clube, still a junior. In 1990, the 17-year-old joined São Paulo FC, spending his first six seasons in Série A as a backup or third-choice.
On 25 June 1993 Ceni made his first team debut, starting in a 4–1 win against CD Tenerife for the Trofeo Ciudad de Santiago de Compostela friendly championship. In the following year he was utilized as a starter in the year's Copa CONMEBOL, appearing in all matches as his side was crowned champions.
In the 1997 season, after legendary Zetti moved to Santos FC, Ceni was chosen as his replacement. On 14 July 2005, Ceni was São Paulo's captain as the team won the 2005 Copa Libertadores, a third for the club. Two weeks later, in a match against Clube Atlético Mineiro, he broke the record for most appearances for the team, with 618 matches – he wore a special commemorative jersey that had the number "618" printed on the back; on 25 July of the following year, he scored a penalty against Mexican side C.D. Guadalajara (also a match-winner), becoming the Tricolor's all-time leading scorer in the Libertadores.
From 2005–07, he scored an astonishing 47 goals in all competitions combined, as the club won two national championships and the 2005 FIFA Club World Cup; in the latter competition, he netted in the semifinals against Ittihad FC (3–2, through a penalty kick), and was voted Man of the match in the final against Liverpool, as well as the tournament's MVP.
On 20 August 2006, Ceni scored his 63rd and record-breaking goal by netting a free kick against Cruzeiro Esporte Clube in the domestic league, a few minutes after denying a penalty to the opposition. Later in the same match, he scored a goal from the spot and took his total to 64, also tying the match 2–2; this put him two goals ahead of the previous holder, Paraguayan José Luis Chilavert.
On 29 October 2006, Ceni made his 700th official appearance for São Paulo, against Figueirense Futebol Clube in a 2–0 victory. Some of the gloss was taken off the occasion when the player was ordered to change his bright yellow jersey because it clashed with the referee's; at the end of the 2007 season, which ended in league conquest, he was voted by the Brazilian Football Confederation as the Best Player.
In April 2009, Ceni fractured his ankle in training, being initially sidelined for six months, but recovering sooner than expected. On 28 October 2010, against Clube Atlético Paranaense, he played his 700th game as club captain. The following year, on 27 March, he scored from a free kick to win it against arch rivals Sport Club Corinthians Paulista, shooting from 18 metres for his 100th goal.
On 7 September 2011, Ceni made his 1000th appearance for São Paulo. In late January of the following year, the 39-year-old underwent an operation on his shoulder, losing six months of competition.
On 1 August 2012 Ceni returned to the field, scoring from a direct free kick in a 2–0 Copa Sudamericana away win against Esporte Clube Bahia; his side went on to win that year's tournament. He subsequently scored three goals in the league, ending the campaign as a starter.
Despite already aged 40, Ceni stated that his spirit for competition was the same as an eighteen-year-old's, but still stating that his recovery is harder than years ago. On 14 July 2013, Ceni scored his 111th goal from a free kick in a 2–3 loss at Esporte Clube Vitória.
On 7 December 2013, after lengthy negotiations, Ceni renewed his contract with Tricolor for a further season. On 20 April 2014, in a 3–0 home win against Botafogo, he had three records recognized by Guinness World Records: most goals scored by a goalkeeper, number of games played for the same club and amount of times as captain.
On 27 October 2014, Ceni broke Ryan Giggs' record for most wins at a single club after playing in São Paulo's 3–0 win over Goiás. He finished the campaign with eight league goals (his best goal scoring record within seven years), being an undisputed starter.
On 28 November 2014 Ceni signed a new deal with São Paulo, until August 2015, despite previously stating that he would retire at the end of the season. On 29 March 2015, after scoring in a 3–0 home win against Linense, he surpassed Marcelinho Carioca in the number of goals scored by direct free kicks for only one club, with Ceni having 60 and Marcelinho, 59.
In June 2015, Ceni scored his 128th goal, entering in the club's top 10 goalscorers list. Ceni announced his retirement from professional football on 6 December 2015.
A Brazilian international for nine years, Ceni collected 16 caps. He was selected to the squads that won the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2002 FIFA World Cup (and the 2006 World Cup, still not fully recovered from knee surgery), but only appeared in two games in final stages, the 3–2 win against Mexico in the first tournament and the 4–1 triumph over Japan in the third.
A dead-ball specialist, Ceni was the official taker of free kicks and penalties for São Paulo FC from 1997 until his retirement, a time period in which he scored 131 goals. In addition to his accurate set-pieces, prolific goalscoring, distribution, and ability with the ball at his feet, he was also known as an excellent goalkeeper and shot-stopper, and stood out for his determination and longevity throughout his career. Ceni was known for being capable of producing brilliant saves, such as those in the final of the 2005 FIFA Club World Championship, which saw São Paulo defeat Liverpool F.C. 1–0; for his performances, Ceni later won the Golden Ball, which is awarded to the competition's best player.
Ceni is of Italian and German descent. He holds Italian citizenship. He revealed that his surname was originally spelled "Cenni" but was changed to Ceni by his paternal great-grandfather who emigrated to Brazil from Mantua in the 1800s.
Ceni is different from several footballers: he prefers rock instead of pagode, a Brazilian musical style, common among football players, and has a more classical style of dressing. According to Ceni: "I like to dress in a good way. I like to kick free kicks. I do not do to make myself. I feel well."
