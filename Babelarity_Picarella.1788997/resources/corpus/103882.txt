Fife is a city in Pierce County, Washington, United States and a suburb of Tacoma. The population was 9,173 at the 2010 census. The population was 9,970 at 2015 Estimate from Office of Financial Management.
In 1940, it was described as "Fife...at a valley crossroads in the midst of a thickly settled berry growing and truck-gardening district is represented by a string of markets, taverns, shops, and a large, balloon-roofed dance hall along the highway." The 1940 population was 135. Fife was officially incorporated on February 11, 1957.
Due to the increased traffic volume traveling from Puyallup and Tacoma, Fife felt the need to establish itself as autonomous community, not just as an intermediate area between Interstate 5 (I-5) and State Route 167.
Fife may have been named for William J. Fife, a prominent Tacoma lawyer, Yukon prospector, once head of the Washington National Guard, and a Lieutenant Colonel in the field during the Philippine Insurrection.
Fife is a small city located east of Tacoma and consists primarily of businesses such as car dealerships, warehousing and industrial facilities, motels, an Indian casino, drive through smokeshops, quick-dining restaurants, and other highway-side businesses. Its proximity to the Port of Tacoma, Interstate 5, and Highway 167 has contributed to the large number of freight forwarding companies. Fife's tax base is made up of sales tax, utility tax, and property tax. Fife Heights, located on a hill beyond the incorporated bounds of the city, is a primarily residential area. Milton is immediately to the east and Edgewood is to the southeast.
Fife is located at 47°14′4″N 122°21′35″W (47.234439, -122.359690).
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 5.83 square miles (15.10 km2), of which, 5.69 square miles (14.74 km2) is land and 0.14 square miles (0.36 km2) is water.
Fife is also a tideflat community, residing in the low, flat area extending from the Port of Tacoma. This means the water table occurs only 10–15 feet below ground in some parts. Consequently, during the day as the tide rises and falls in the Puget Sound, so do parts of land slightly rise and fall.
The southern portions of the city are in the floodplain of the Puyallup River. Much of the city would be damaged or destroyed in the event of a lahar due to an eruption of Mount Rainier.
