Allen is a 6th-class city in Floyd County, Kentucky, in the United States. The population was 193 at the 2010 census, up from 150 at the 2000 census.
Allen was first settled in the early nineteenth century. The first post office was named "Mouth of Beaver" and was established on August 21, 1854 (Thomas P. Johns, postmaster). The town began to develop rapidly c. 1904-1905 after the establishment of a Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad station. The station was interchangeably known as "Beaver Creek" and "Beaver Creek Junction". In 1905, another post office opened and was named "Allen" after local resident T.J. Allen. The town was formally incorporated by the state assembly in 1913. In 1936, the railroad station was renamed to prevent confusion during mail delivery. An area outside the city limits known as "New Allen" began to develop in 1937 after a bridge was constructed across the Levisa Fork River.
