The saffron toucanet (Pteroglossus bailloni) is a species of bird in the Ramphastidae family. It was formerly placed in the monotypic genus Baillonius, but Kimura et al. (2004) was able to show that the saffron toucanet belongs in the genus Pteroglossus. It is found in Atlantic Forest in far north-eastern Argentina, south-eastern Brazil, and eastern Paraguay.
It is a relatively long-tailed toucan with a total length of 35–40 cm (14–16 in). As suggested by its common name, it is, uniquely among toucans, overall saffron yellow. The back and tail are darker, more olive in colour. The rump, ocular skin and patches on the basal half of the otherwise greenish-horn bill are red. The iris is pale yellowish.
This species' scientific name honors Louis Antoine François Baillon.
It is threatened by habitat loss and currently considered Near Threatened by BirdLife International. It occurs in several protected areas, such as the Itatiaia National Park and Parque Estadual Intervales; both in south-eastern Brazil.
