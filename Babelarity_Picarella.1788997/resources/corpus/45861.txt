Losco won the Maltese national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2016 on 23 January, with the song Chameleon.
Losco represented Malta at the Eurovision Song Contest 2002 with the song “7th Wonder”. She finished runner up, just 12 points behind eventual winner Marie N, which was Malta’s highest result ever in the competition until it was equaled in 2005.
In December 2015, it was revealed that Losco had submitted two songs for the Malta Eurovision Song Contest 2016, the country’s national selection process. Her entries “Chameleon” and “That’s why I love you” were both shortlisted for the semifinal, with “Chameleon” qualifying for the final. On 23 January, Ira won the national selection with over 40% of the votes cast by the Maltese public.
Following Losco's win at the Malta Eurovision Song Contest 2016, the singer stated that she was open to the idea of performing a song other than "Chameleon" at Eurovision, should it improve Malta's chances of winning. The national final rules, set by PBS, allow for the winning song to be partially modified or completely changed. On 19 February 2016, PBS announced that an international jury consisting of representatives from ten countries, along with local experts from Malta, would be presented with several songs, including a revamped version of "Chameleon", and would determine which song Losco would perform at the contest. On 14 March it was announced that Ira would perform the song "Walk on Water". The song and video were released on 17 March 2016.
The dress worn by Losco for the contest was by Alex Zabotto-Bentley, who has also designed for Lady Gaga, Prince and Kylie Minogue. It was revealed that to increase the chance of winning the contest, the budget was increased drastically, from minimum €200,000 in a previous given year to an approximate maximum of €1,500,000 during the Losco's participation in 2016. In the first semi-final, on 10 May 2016, "Walk on Water" qualified for the Eurovision final. In the final on Saturday 14 May 2016, she placed 12th out of 26 countries.
Losco has publicly expressed her support for a number of social causes in Malta, including LGBT rights and anti-bullying campaigns amongst teenagers. In 2014, she was nominated for the first LGBTI Community Awards organised by the Malta Gay Rights Movement. Ira supports equal rights and acceptance, rather than just tolerance, in context that her country, Malta, has been known as the best country in Europe and the world in LGBTQI rights. Losco organised an LGBT friendly party in Stockholm during the Eurovision song contest 2016.
