In 1834, Mikhail Zagoskin published a collection of ghost stories entitled An Evening on the Khoper River.
According to legend, an oldman Hopper lived in these places of Penza Oblast. One day he went by steppe and saw 12 springs. The old man took a shovel and assembled all the springs in one big stream. On this stream oldman Hopper built a mill to grind grain for the peasants from nearby villages. Later the river was given the name of its creator.
The river gave its name to the Khoper-Invest company, infamous for its pyramid scheme fraud.
