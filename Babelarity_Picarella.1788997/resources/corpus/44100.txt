Bananas is the 17th studio album by English rock band Deep Purple, released on September 9, 2003 via EMI and Sanctuary Records labels.
This is the first Deep Purple album to feature Don Airey on the keyboards, replacing founder member Jon Lord. The album was recorded in Los Angeles during January and February 2003.
It charted well, despite lack of media exposure, especially in Europe and South America (notably at Germany and Argentina, where it peaked in the top 10).
It is also notable as being the only Deep Purple album featuring Ian Gillan which makes use of backing vocals other than his own, with the song "Haunted" featuring a female backing singer, Beth Hart.
It includes "Contact Lost", a short, slow instrumental about the Columbia astronauts, written by guitarist Steve Morse when he heard the sad news of the crash.
All songs written by Ian Gillan, Roger Glover, Steve Morse, Don Airey, and Ian Paice except where noted.

Since the Abandon album, Deep Purple performed three new songs onstage. "Long Time Gone" was debuted in the summer of 2000 but not included on Bananas. Another new song, "Up The Wall" was played on the 2002 UK tour, and reworked into "I've Got Your Number". The instrumental "Well Dressed Guitar" was unreleased until the next album, 2005's Rapture of the Deep.
