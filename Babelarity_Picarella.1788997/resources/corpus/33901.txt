Daphne (/ˈdæfniː/; Greek: Δάφνη, meaning "laurel") is a genus of between 50 and 95 species of deciduous and evergreen shrubs in the family Thymelaeaceae, native to Asia, Europe and north Africa. They are noted for their scented flowers and poisonous berries.
The leaves are undivided, mostly arranged alternately (although opposite in D. genkwa). The flowers lack petals and have four (rarely five) petaloid sepals, tubular at the base with free lobes at the apex. The flowers are grouped, either in clusters in the leaf axils towards the end of the stems or in terminal heads. They range in colour from greenish-yellow to white, bright pink and purple; most of the evergreen species have greenish flowers, while the deciduous species tend to have pink flowers. Many species flower in late winter or very early spring. The fruits are one-seeded drupes, which in some species are fleshy and berry-like, in others dry and leathery.
Numerous natural and artificial hybrids are cultivated as ornamental plants. These include:
D. × burkwoodii - D. cneorum × D. caucasica
D. × hendersonii Hodgkin ex C.D.Brickell – natural hybrid D. petraea × D. cneorum 
D. × napolitana Lodd. has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. – origin not known 
D. × schlyteri – artificial hybrid D. cneorum × D. arbuscula
D. × thauma Farrer – natural hybrid D. petraea × D. striata 
One species, Daphne papyracea, the Lokta plant, is sustainably harvested in Nepal and Bhutan for paper production.
Many species are cultivated as ornamental shrubs in gardens. The smaller species are used as rock garden plants or, in the case of those more difficult to grow, as plants for the alpine house.
