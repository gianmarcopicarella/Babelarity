An exanthem or exanthema (from Greek ἐξάνθημα exánthēma, "a breaking out") is a widespread rash usually occurring in children. An exanthem can be caused by toxins, drugs, or microorganisms, or can result from autoimmune disease.
It can be contrasted with an enanthem.
Historically, six "classical" infectious childhood exanthems have been recognized, four of which are viral. Numbers were provided in 1905.
The four viral exanthema have much in common, and are often studied together as a class. They include:
Scarlet fever, or "second disease", is associated with the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes. (Measles and scarlet fever were distinguished in the 17th century.) Fourth disease, a condition whose existence is not widely accepted today, was described in 1900 and is postulated to be related to the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus.
Many other common viruses apart from the ones mentioned above can also produce an exanthem as part of their presentation, though they are not considered part of the classic numbered list:
Varicella zoster virus (chickenpox or shingles)
Mumps
rhinovirus (the common cold)
unilateral laterothoracic exanthem of childhood
Some types of viral haemorrhagic fever are also known to produce a systemic rash of this kind during the progression of the disease.
Tick-borne diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever produce a rash that may become extensive enough so as to be classified as exanthemous in as many as 90% of children with the disease.
Vaccinations now exist against measles, mumps, rubella (as a part of the MMR vaccine) and chickenpox.
