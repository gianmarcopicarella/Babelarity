Jérôme Eugène Coggia (18 February 1849 – 15 January 1919) was a 19th-century French (Corsican) astronomer.
Working at the Marseille Observatory from 1866 to 1917, Coggia discovered a number of comets, including the bright "Coggia's Comet" (C/1874 H1). The periodic comet 27P/Crommelin was previously called "Comet Pons-Coggia-Winnecke-Forbes". He was awarded by the French Academy of Sciences its Lalande Prize for 1873 and again for 1916.
