Year 98 (XCVIII) was a common year starting on Monday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Augustus and Traianus (or, less frequently, year 851 Ab urbe condita). The denomination 98 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
Emperor Nerva suffers a stroke during a private audience. Shortly after he dies of a fever at his villa in the Gardens of Sallust.
January 27 – Nerva is succeeded by his adopted son Trajan.
Trajan is the first Roman Emperor born in Italica, near Seville. A brilliant soldier and administrator, he enters Rome without ceremony and wins over the public. Continuing the policies of Augustus, Vespasian and Nerva, he restores the Senate to its full status in the government. He has a specific vision of the Empire, and keeps a close watch on finances. Taxes, without any increase, are sufficient during his reign to pay the considerable costs of the budget.
The informers used by Domitian to support his tyranny are expelled from Rome.
In order to maintain the Port of Alexandria, Trajan reopens the canal between the Nile and the Red Sea.
