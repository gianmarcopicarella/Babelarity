In zoology, mammalogy is the study of mammals â€“ a class of vertebrates with characteristics such as homeothermic metabolism, fur, four-chambered hearts, and complex nervous systems. Mammalogy has also been known as "mastology," "theriology," and "therology." There are about 4,200 different species of animals which are considered mammals. The major branches to study in the mammalogy career include natural history, taxonomy and systematics, anatomy and physiology, ethology, ecology, and management and control. The approximate salary of a mammalogist varies from $20,000 to $60,000 a year, depending on their experience. Mammalogists are typically involved in activities such as conducting research, managing personnel, and writing proposals.
Mammalogy branches off into other taxonomically-oriented disciplines such as primatology (study of primates), and cetology (study of cetaceans).
Students seeking a career in mammalogy may be disappointed to know that there are more mammalogists seeking employment than there are positions and this doesn't look like it will change in the foreseeable future. The competition surrounding open positions will be intense which behooves mammalogists to obtain the best training possible. Summer employment or volunteer work can be extremely valuable in this type of situation. Most positions in mammalogy will require a broad undergraduate background with the coursework depending on the specific field of mammalogy.
This is a list of scientific journals broadly serving mammalogists. In addition, many other more general zoology, ecology and evolution, or conservation journals also deal with mammals, and several journals are specific to only certain taxonomic groups of mammals.
