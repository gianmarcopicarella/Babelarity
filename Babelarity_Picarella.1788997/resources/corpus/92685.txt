The red-fronted antpecker (Parmoptila rubrifrons) is a species of songbird found in Western Africa. Like all antpeckers, it is tentatively placed in the estrildid finch family (Estrildidae). It often contains the eastern Jameson's antpecker (P. jamesoni) as a subspecies.
This bird inhabits tropical lowland moist forest in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, Ghana and CÃ´te d'Ivoire. When Jameson's and the red-fronted antpeckers were still evaluated as one species, they were classified as a species of least concern by the IUCN. However, the red-fronted antpecker is declining noticeably due to habitat destruction and has entirely disappeared from Mali for example. Therefore, its status has been changed to near threatened after the taxonomic split.
