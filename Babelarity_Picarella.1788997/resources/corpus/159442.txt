Sherman County is a county located in the U.S. state of Oregon. As of the 2010 census, the population was 1,765, making it the second-least populous county in Oregon. The county seat is Moro, and the largest city is Wasco. The county is named for William Tecumseh Sherman, a Union general in the American Civil War.
As the pioneers felt crowded in the new settlements of western Oregon, they turned east to the Columbia Plateau for new opportunities. The county's first white settler was William Graham, who located at the mouth of the Deschutes River in 1858. Homesteaders, eager for land, arrived in the 1880s by steamboat, stagecoach and wagon. Soon farmers received government patents.
As the population grew, so did the sentiment for independence from Wasco County. Sherman County was created on February 25, 1889 out of the northeast corner of Wasco County. The county's borders have been changed only once, in 1891, when the Legislative Assembly moved the county line 18 miles (29 km) farther south into Wasco County.
The town of Wasco was designated the county seat by the Legislative Assembly although this designation was contested between Wasco and Moro. Following the addition of a portion of Wasco County, Moro became the eventual winner.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 831 square miles (2,150 km2), of which 824 square miles (2,130 km2) is land and 7.5 square miles (19 km2) (0.9%) is water.
