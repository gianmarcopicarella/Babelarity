The Slovenia women's national football team is the national football team of Slovenia and is controlled by the Football Association of Slovenia. They played their first match in 1993 after the split of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1991. Before that, Slovenian players played for the Yugoslav national team.
Slovenia made its official debut on 25 September 1993 against England in the qualifying for the 1995 European Championship. They lost all six qualifiers with a 0–60 goal average, including a record 17–0 loss against Spain. After this Slovenia didn't take part in official competitions for more than a decade.
They returned in 2005 for the 2007 World Cup qualification, where they didn't have options to qualify since back then a two-division format with promotions and relegations was held and they started in the lower category. For the 2009 European Championship the two divisions were merged into one, and Slovenia made it to the play-offs as one of the four best 3rd-ranked teams, their biggest success to date. There they were knocked out by Ukraine by a 0–5 aggregate.
In the 2011 World Cup and 2013 European Championship qualifiers Slovenia ended fourth out of five teams, with 6 and 4 points respectively.
