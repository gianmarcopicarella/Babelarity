Mayta Cápac (Quechua Mayta Qhapaq Inka) was the fourth Sapa Inca of the Kingdom of Cuzco (beginning around 1290 CE) and a member of the Hurin dynasty.
As a son of King Lloque Yupanqui, Mayta Cápac was his heir and the father of Cápac Yupanqui. His wife's name is given as Mama Tankariy Yachiy, or Tacucaray, or Mama Cuca. His other children were Tarco Huaman, Apu Cunti Mayta, Queco Avcaylli, and Rocca Yupanqui.
Mayta's mother was Mama Cora Ocllo Coya. She died in Cuzco.
The chroniclers describe him as a great warrior who conquered territories as far as Lake Titicaca, Arequipa, and Potosí. While in fact, his kingdom was still limited to the valley of Cuzco. In 1134, Mayta Cápac put the regions of Arequipa and Moquegua under the control of the Inca empire.
His great military feat was the subjugation of Alcabisas and Culunchimas tribes.
