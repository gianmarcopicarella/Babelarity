In vector calculus, a vector potential is a vector field whose curl is a given vector field. This is analogous to a scalar potential, which is a scalar field whose gradient is a given vector field.
Formally, given a vector field v, a vector potential is a vector A such that
          v
        =
        ∇
        ×
          A
        .
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} =\nabla \times \mathbf {A} .}
If a vector field v admits a vector potential A, then from the equality
        ∇
        ⋅
        (
        ∇
        ×
          A
        )
        =
        0
    {\displaystyle \nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf {A} )=0}
(divergence of the curl is zero) one obtains
        ∇
        ⋅
          v
        =
        ∇
        ⋅
        (
        ∇
        ×
          A
        )
        =
        0
        ,
    {\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {v} =\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf {A} )=0,}
which implies that v must be a solenoidal vector field.
Let
          v
        :
            R
            3
        →
            R
            3
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} :\mathbb {R} ^{3}\to \mathbb {R} ^{3}}
be a solenoidal vector field which is twice continuously differentiable. Assume that v(x) decreases sufficiently fast as ||x||→∞. Define
          A
        (
          x
        )
        =
            1
              4
              π
          ∫
                R
                3
                ∇
                  y
              ×
                v
              (
                y
              )
              ∥
                x
              −
                y
              ∥
          d
            3
          y
        .
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} (\mathbf {x} )={\frac {1}{4\pi }}\int _{\mathbb {R} ^{3}}{\frac {\nabla _{y}\times \mathbf {v} (\mathbf {y} )}{\left\|\mathbf {x} -\mathbf {y} \right\|}}\,d^{3}\mathbf {y} .}
Then, A is a vector potential for v, that is,
        ∇
        ×
          A
        =
          v
        .
    {\displaystyle \nabla \times \mathbf {A} =\mathbf {v} .}
A generalization of this theorem is the Helmholtz decomposition which states that any vector field can be decomposed as a sum of a solenoidal vector field and an irrotational vector field.
The vector potential admitted by a solenoidal field is not unique. If A is a vector potential for v, then so is
          A
        +
        ∇
        m
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} +\nabla m}
where m is any continuously differentiable scalar function. This follows from the fact that the curl of the gradient is zero.
This nonuniqueness leads to a degree of freedom in the formulation of electrodynamics, or gauge freedom, and requires choosing a gauge.
