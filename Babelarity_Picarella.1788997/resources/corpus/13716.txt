Lu Jun (Chinese: 陆俊; pinyin: Lù Jùn; born March 19, 1959) is a soccer referee from China. He supervised two matches in the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan, one between Croatia and Mexico in Niigata, and another between Poland and the United States in Daejeon. He also officiated the 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup in China, the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup in Japan and South Korea and the 2000 Olympics.
In 2010, Lu was arrested along with two other Chinese referees for accepting bribes and match fixing. As state workers, the men could have faced the death penalty if found guilty. He was sentenced to five and a half years in jail and fined $128,000 in February 2012 after admitting taking bribes to fix the results of seven games.
