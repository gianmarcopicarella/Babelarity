The Paraguayan Footballer of the Year is an award given to the best Paraguayan professional football player every year. The award began officially in 1997 and it is presented by Paraguayan newspaper Diario ABC Color. Players that participate in this award can play in any professional football club in the world (they don't necessarily have to be Paraguayan football clubs) and have to be either Paraguayan-born or Paraguayan-naturalised players.
Note: the 1999 winner, Roque Santa Cruz, appears both as a Club Olimpia and Bayern Munich player because he played the first half of 1999 in Olimpia of Asunci√≥n before eventually being transferred to Bayern Munich in the second half of 1999. The same applies for the 2006 winner.
