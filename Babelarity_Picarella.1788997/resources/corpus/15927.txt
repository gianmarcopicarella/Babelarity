Ernest James Renshaw (3 January 1861 â€“ 2 September 1899) was a former World No. 1 English tennis player.
Together with his twin brother William Renshaw, Ernest won the men's doubles at Wimbledon five times. He also won the singles championship at Wimbledon once, in 1888 and was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1983. He won the singles title at the Irish Championships on four occasions (1883, 1887, 1888, 1892). Ernest was the older of the brothers by 15 minutes and half an inch taller.
The boom in popularity of the game during the 1880s due to the modern tennis style of the Renshaw brothers became known as the 'Renshaw Rush'.
He died of the effects of carbolic acid but whether taken intentionally or not the evidence did not show.
In 1983, Ernest Renshaw was elected posthumously into the International Tennis Hall of Fame together with his brother.
