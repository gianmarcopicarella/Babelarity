Jonathan Mensah (Akan: /mɛnˈsæh/ men-SAH) (born 13 July 1990), commonly known simply as Jonathan, is a Ghanaian professional footballer who currently plays as a defender for Russian Football Premier League club FC Anzhi Makhachkala and the Ghana national team.
To avoid confusion with the similarly named but unrelated John Mensah, he is typically known as and plays with the name "Jonathan" on his shirt.
Jonathan joined Free State Stars in the 2008 off-season and was signed from top Ghanaian side Ashanti Gold. In July 2009, there was speculation about a possible move to Greek club Panathinaikos, but Jonathan ultimately decided to stay at his South African club.
In January 2010, after joining Udinese, Jonathan moved to Spanish club Granada on loan.
On 8 July 2011, Jonathan moved to newly promoted French Ligue 1 side Evian, signing a four-year contract for undisclosed fee.
During the 2012-13 season, Jonathan struggled with fitness and form. He played six games with the reserve side in the Championnat de France Amateur level 2. Jonathan returned to the first team in 2013, and featured in the club's opening game of the 2013-14 Ligue 1 campaign, playing the full ninety minutes in the club's 1-1 draw with Sochaux on 10 August 2013.
On 25 May 2015, Mensah was banned for four months by FIFA in a breach-of-contract case, that judged that Mensah was still contracted to Udinese when he joined Evian four years prior claiming to be a free agent.
On 23 February 2016, he signed a 2.5-year contract with the Russian club FC Anzhi Makhachkala.
In 2009, Jonathan was in the Ghana team for the under 20 youth championship in Kigali and helped Ghana claim the prestigious cup. Jonathan's performances during this competition earned him a call-up to the 2010 World Cup, held in South Africa where he was given the number 8 shirt usually worn by Michael Essien. Jonathan established himself as a central defensive partner for John Mensah in the absence, through injury, of first-choice centre back Isaac Vorsah. Jonathan played in two out of the three group stage games for Ghana at the 2010 FIFA World Cup and also in the round of 16 win against United States.
On 2 June 2014, Mensah was named in Ghana's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. In the team's opening match, he was in the starting line-up for the Black Stars against the United States in a 2–1 defeat. Mensah played every minute of Ghana's 2015 Africa Cup of Nations campaign, helping them reach the final, where they lost in a penalty shootout against the Ivory Coast.
