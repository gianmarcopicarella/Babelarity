Pugo was born in Kalinin, Russian SFSR (now Tver, Russia) into a family of Latvian communists who had left Latvia after Latvia was proclaimed an independent country in 1918 and the Communist side defeated in the war that followed. His family returned to Latvia after the Soviet Union occupied and annexed it in 1940.
Pugo graduated from Riga Polytechnical in 1960 and worked in various Komsomol, Communist Party and Soviet government positions, both in Latvia and Moscow. His positions between 1960 and 1984 included the first secretary of the Central Committee of Komsomol of Latvian SSR, a secretary of the Central Committee of Komsomol of USSR, the first secretary of Riga City Committee of Communist Party and the chairman of KGB in Latvia.

Between 1990 and 1991, he was the Minister of the Interior Affairs of the USSR. He was a member of the August Coup in 1991 and as the minister of interior firmly supported measures to suppress opposition to the coup. After the coup had failed, he committed suicide, anticipating arrest. He was contacted by the RSFSR prosecution for a meeting and he shot his wife and himself minutes after the phone call.
