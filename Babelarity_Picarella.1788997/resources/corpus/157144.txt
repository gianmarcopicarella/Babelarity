Because of its rich volcanic soil, agriculture is important in Giruá, notably soy production. Its nickname is the Capital of Productivity. Other important crops are maize, wheat, sunflower and linseed.
The area of Giruá was first inhabited by the Guarani people, and in the 17th century Jesuit missions arrived. The name Giruá comes from jerivá, an indigenous word for the fruit of the butia palm.
