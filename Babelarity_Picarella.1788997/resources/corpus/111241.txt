Louis of Évreux (3 May 1276 – 19 May 1319, Paris) was a prince, the third son of King Philip III of France and his second wife Maria of Brabant, and thus a half-brother of King Philip IV of France.
Louis had a quiet and reflective personality and was politically opposed to the scheming of his half-brother Charles of Valois. He was, however, close with his nephew Philip V of France.
He married Margaret of Artois, daughter of Philip of Artois and sister of Robert III of Artois, and had five children:
Marie (1303 – 31 October 1335), married in 1311 John III, Duke of Brabant
Charles (1305–1336), Count of Étampes married Maria de la Cerda, Lady of Lunel, daughter of Fernando de la Cerda.
Philip III of Navarre (1306–1343), married Joan II of Navarre.
Margaret (1307–1350), married in 1325 William XII of Auvergne
Joan (1310–1370), married Charles IV of France
Louis is a character in Les Rois maudits (The Accursed Kings), a series of French historical novels by Maurice Druon. He was portrayed by Robert Party in the 1972 French miniseries adaptation of the series.
