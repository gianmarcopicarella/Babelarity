Geumcheon District (Geumcheon-gu) is one of the 25 gu (districts) of Seoul, South Korea. It was created from southern parts of Guro-gu and tiny sections from Gwangmyeong in 1995. Its district office is located in front of Siheung Station, now Geumcheon-gu Office Station, in Siheung-dong.
Geumcheon-gu is located in the southwest corner of the city, south of the Han River. It is bordered on the west by the Anyang River, and partially on the east by Gwanak Mountain, a dominating part of Seoul's southern skyline.
Many technology companies are housed in Geumcheon-gu and several large headquarters are located here, albeit the income level of Seoulites here is lower than average. The Gyeongbu railway from Seoul station to Busan Station passes through, as well as Seoul Subway Lines 1 and 7.
The mayor of this district has been Cha Sung-su (차성수) since July 2010.
