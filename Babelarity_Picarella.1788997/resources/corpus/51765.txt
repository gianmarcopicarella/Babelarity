Socket 6 was a 486-generation CPU socket, a slightly modified version of the more common Socket 3. It was used in a few motherboards.
Intel designed this new standard near the end of the 80486's market life. So few motherboards, if any, were produced that used it, especially as the Socket 3 standard was already sufficient.
