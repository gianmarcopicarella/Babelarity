Phenoxyethanol is a germicidal and germistatic glycol ether, phenol ether, and aromatic alcohol often used together with quaternary ammonium compounds.
Phenoxyethanol is used as a perfume fixative; an insect repellent; an antiseptic; a solvent for cellulose acetate, dyes, inks, and resins; a preservative for pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and lubricants; an anesthetic in fish aquaculture; and in organic synthesis.
Phenoxyethanol is an alternative to formaldehyde-releasing preservatives. In Japan and the EU, its concentration in cosmetics is restricted to 1%.
Phenoxyethanol is produced by the hydroxyethylation of phenol (Williamson synthesis), for example, in the presence of alkali-metal hydroxides or alkali-metal borohydrides.
Phenoxyethanol is effective against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, and the yeast Candida albicans.
Phenoxyethanol is a vaccine preservative and potential allergen, which may result in a nodular reaction at the site of injection. It is neurotoxic. Ingestion may cause CNS and respiratory depression, vomiting and diarrhea in infants, particularly when combined with chlorphenesin.
