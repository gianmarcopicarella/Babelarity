Corentin Martins da Silva (born 11 July 1969) is a former French footballer who played as an attacking midfielder, and the current manager of the Mauritanian national team.
Martins was born in Brest, Brittany. After starting at hometown's Stade Brestois 29, he moved to AJ Auxerre in 1991, being a crucial part of an emergent side led by legendary Guy Roux: in 1992–93 they reached the UEFA Cup semifinals and, four years later, achieved an historical double.
On 30 May 1996, Martins signed with Deportivo de La Coruña from Spain. After an impressive first season in La Liga he lost his importance in the squad due to injuries, and returned in January 1998 to France, joining RC Strasbourg for one 1/2 years.
After a loan to FC Girondins de Bordeaux, Martins rejoined Strasbourg until 2004, and closed out his career with Clermont Foot. In 2006 he started his manager career, with lowly Quimper Cornouaille FC. In the following year he was named his first club's director of football, but had a brief spell as interim coach in the beginnings of the 2008–09 campaign; he subsequently stayed on the bench, now as an assistant for the Ligue 2 team.
During 2011–12 and 2012–13, Martins acted as caretaker for Brest as a replacement for sacked Alex Dupont and Landry Chauvin, respectively. After managing to avert top flight relegation in the former season, he lost all eight matches he was in charge in the latter, with the subsequent 20th position in the table and relegation.
Martins earned his first cap for France on 27 March 1993, in a 1–0 win against Austria. He represented the nation at UEFA Euro 1996 and gained a total of 14 caps, but his international career was vastly undermined by the emergence of Zinedine Zidane.
On 8 October 2014, Martins was appointed manager of Mauritania.
