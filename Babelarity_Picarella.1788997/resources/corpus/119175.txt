63 Ausonia (/ɔːˈsoʊniə/ aw-SOH-nee-ə) is a large main belt asteroid. It was discovered by Annibale de Gasparis on February 10, 1861 from the Astronomical Observatory of Capodimonte, Naples. The initial choice of name for the asteroid was "Italia", after Italy, but this was modified to Ausonia, an ancient classical name for the Italian region.
Based on its lightcurve, a small moon has been suggested. [1]
