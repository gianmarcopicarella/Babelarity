A lacrosse game was played between Canada and Great Britain at the 1908 Summer Olympics. The game marked the second appearance of lacrosse at the Olympics, the first being at the 1904 Summer Olympics. Only two teams competed â€” one fewer than in 1904. South Africa was slated to send a team but then withdrew prior to the tournament.
