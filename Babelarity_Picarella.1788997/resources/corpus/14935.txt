Sevilla Atlético Club is a Spanish football team based in Seville, in the autonomous community of Andalusia. Founded in 1958 it plays in Segunda División B and is the reserve team of Sevilla FC, holding home games at Viejo Nervión, with a 7,500-seat capacity.
Unlike in England, reserve teams in Spain play in the same football pyramid as their senior team rather than a separate league. However, reserve teams cannot play in the same division as their senior team. Therefore, the team is ineligible for promotion to La Liga, the division in which the main side plays. Reserve teams are also no longer permitted to enter the Copa del Rey.
Founded in 1958, Sevilla Atlético quickly reached Tercera División, winning the competition in 1961 and 1962 and also spending the 1962–63 season in Segunda División. After three years in the regional leagues in the early 1970s, the club returned to the third level in 1976.
In 1977 Segunda División B was created as the new third division, and Sevilla B spent time in that and the fourth categories. In 1999 it fell short in the second level promotion play-offs, after finishing the regular season as runner-up – earlier, in 1991, the club changed its name to Sevilla Fútbol Club B. In the following decade, in spite of three consecutive top-three finishes, the team underachieved in the playoffs; in the 2006–07 season, however, after a 1–0 aggregate win against Burgos courtesy of a Lolo goal in the second leg at home, it returned to division two after more than 40 years of absence. In 2006, it was again renamed Sevilla Atlético.
After two seasons in division two, with a ninth place in the first year, in a campaign which also saw manager Manuel Jiménez leave to take the reins of the first team, Sevilla Atlético returned again to the third. Sevilla Atlético finished their 2015–16 campaign in 3rd place in Group 4 and qualified for the promotion play-offs, they beat Lleida Esportiu in the penalties 5–4 and therefore promoted back to Segunda División after 7 years.
