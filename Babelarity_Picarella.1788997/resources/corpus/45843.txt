The Swiss Hitparade (German: Schweizer Hitparade) are Switzerland's main music sales charts. The charts are a record of the highest-selling singles and albums in various genres in Switzerland.
The Swiss charts include:
Singles Top 75 (released since 1968)
Albums Top 100 (released since late 1983)
Compilations Top 25
Airplay Top 30
Since 2010, Hitparade's compiler Media Control has also set up Les charts, a record chart of the highest-selling singles and albums in Romandie, the Francophone region of Switzerland:
Romandie Singles Top 20
Romandie Albums Top 50
The charts are updated weekly on Sundays, and are posted publicly on the preceding Wednesday mornings.
