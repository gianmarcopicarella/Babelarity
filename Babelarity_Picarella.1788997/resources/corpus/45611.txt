In early 2014, Wynter formed a 5-piece band called The Righteous Young, of which she is the lead singer. However, Wynter clarified in a Q&A on Facebook that The Righteous young does not mean the end of Wynter Gordon as an act, but is rather an extension of her own music. "The righteous young is my band ... My music, WYNTER and THE RIGHTEOUS YOUNG". She released her first single with The Righteous Young, "Everything Burns", on June 3, 2014. The music video, directed by Harrison Boyce, was exclusively released on Idolator and Vevo on the same day.
