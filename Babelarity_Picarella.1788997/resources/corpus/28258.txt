The Kilo class is the NATO reporting name for a naval diesel-electric submarine that is made in Russia. The original version of the vessels were designated Project 877 Paltus (Halibut) in Soviet Union. There is also a more advanced version, designated as Improved Kilo-class submarine in the West, and Project 636 Varshavyanka in Russia.
These attack submarines are mainly intended for anti-shipping and anti-submarine operations in relatively shallow waters. Original Project 877 boats are equipped with Rubikon MGK-400 sonar system (with NATO reporting name Shark Gill), which includes a mine detection and avoidance sonar MG-519 Arfa (with NATO reporting name Mouse Roar).
Newer Project 636 boats are equipped with improved MGK-400EM, with MG-519 Arfa also upgraded to MG-519EM. The improved sonar systems have reduced the number of operators needed by sharing the same console via automation.
Anechoic tiles are fitted on casings and fins to absorb the sound waves of active sonar, which results in a reduction and distortion of the return signal. These tiles also help attenuate sounds that are emitted from the submarine, thus reducing the range at which the sub may be detected by passive sonar.
The Kilo class was to have been succeeded by the Lada class. In November 2011, the Russian Navy announced that the Lada class will not enter service because trials with the lead boat of the new class, Sankt Peterburg (B-585) had shown major deficiencies. Construction of two further boats was suspended.
On 27 July 2012, the Russian Navy commander-in-chief announced that construction of the Lada-class submarines will resume, having undergone design changes.
One Kilo-class submarine, B-871, was equipped with pump-jet propulsion.
The version Kilo 636MV (exported to Vietnam) contains a GE2-01 radar and an improved MGK 400E sonar. In this version, the submarine is also able to operate in more weather conditions than the original Kilo-class submarines.
The first submarine entered service in the Soviet Navy in 1980, and the class remains in use with the Russian Navy today. As of September 2011, 17 vessels were believed to still be in active service with the Russian Navy, while 7 vessels were thought to be in reserve. 33 vessels have been exported to several countries:
 Algeria : 2 Original Kilo (Project 877), 4 Improved Kilo (Project 636).
 People's Republic of China : 2 Original Kilo (Project 877), 10 Improved Kilo (Project 636).
 India : 10 Original Kilo (Project 877), 1 sustained major casualty; – Designated as the Sindhughosh class
 Poland : 1 Original Kilo (Project 877) – ORP Orzeł.
 Iran : 3 Original Kilo (Project 877).
 Romania : 1 Original Kilo (Project 877) – Delfinul.
 Russia : 22 Original Kilo (Project 877), 4 Improved Kilo (Project 636), 2 Improved Kilo (Project 636) on order.
 Vietnam : 5 Improved Kilo (Project 636), 1 Improved Kilo (Project 636) on order.
The government of Venezuela expressed interest in buying 3 Project 636 Kilo-class submarines
The government of Indonesia in 2007-2008 planned to acquire at least 2 Kilo-class submarines. In October 2013, the ministry of defence of Indonesia reported the possibility of a grant from the Russian government involving up to ten ex-Russian navy Kilo-class submarines. Army General Moeldoko, Indonesian Armed Forces chief of staff, announced that a team will be sent to Russia last month to inspect the condition of future submarines.
