785 Zwetana is a minor planet orbiting the Sun that was discovered by Adam Massinger, an assistant at the Heidelberg Observatory, on March 30, 1914. Radar observations indicate that it is metallic.
In 1990, the asteroid was observed from the European Southern Observatory, allowing a composite light curve to be produced that showed a rotation period of 8.919 ± 0.004 hours and a brightness variation of 0.13 ± 0.01 in magnitude.
