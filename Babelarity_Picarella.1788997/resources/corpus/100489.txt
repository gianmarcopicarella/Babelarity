Christiane Taubira or Christiane Taubira-Delannon (French: [kʁis.tjan to.bi.ʁa]; born 2 February 1952, Cayenne, French Guiana) is a French politician who on 15 May 2012, was appointed Minister of Justice of France in the new Ayrault Government under President François Hollande. She resigned from office on January 27, 2016.
Christiane Taubira was born on 2 February 1952 in Cayenne, French Guiana. She studied at Panthéon-Assas University. Taubira is the sister of French Guianese politician Jean-Marie Taubira, who is Secretary General of the Walwari party which Christiane co-founded.
Having served as President of the Walwari Party, Mme Taubira from 1993 served as a Deputy to the French National Assembly, being re-elected in 1997. Non-affiliated in 1993, she then voted in favour of the conservative Edouard Balladur to form a Cabinet of ministers in 1993. In 1994, she secured election as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP), being the fourth on the Énergie Radicale list led by Bernard Tapie. In June 1997, she then joined the Socialist Party (PS), and then-Prime Minister Lionel Jospin (PS) appointed her to head a government commission into Gold mining in Guiana.
In 2002, Mme Taubira was a Left Radical Party (PRG) candidate for the Presidency, although she did not belong to the Party; she won 2.32% of the votes. After 2002, she became Vice-President of the Left Radical Party. She was elected as its Deputy on 16 June 2002, and chose to join the Socialist group in the Assembly.
Member of European parliament: 1994–1999. Elected in 1994.
Member of the National Assembly of France for French Guiana (1st constituency): 1993–2012. Elected in 1993, re-elected in 1997, 2002, 2007.
Regional Councillor of French Guiana: Since 2010.
Having been nominated Minister of Justice by Jean-Marc Ayrault, following the victory of François Hollande in the 2012 Presidential Elections, she was supposed to work with Junior Minister Delphine Batho. However, their relationship quickly broke down being unable to share responsibilities. After the June 2012 Legislative elections, Delphine Batho was moved to become Minister of Ecology replacing Nicole Bricq, leaving Mme Christiane Taubira in charge of the Ministry of Justice. She resigned her position as Minister of Justice on January 27, 2016 after a disagreement with President Hollande over policies related to the treatment of French Nationals convicted of terrorism.
Taubira was the driving force behind a 21 May 2001 law that recognises the Atlantic slave trade and slavery as a crime against humanity. In 2013, she voiced her support for land reforms in France's Caribbean territories as compensation for slavery.
As Minister of Justice, Taubira formally introduced the electoral promise of François Hollande. It became Law 2013-404, which legalised same-sex marriage in France.
Taubira resigned in January 2016 after openly disagreeing with the French president's proposal to strip French nationality from dual-citizens who are convicted of terrorism, a measure championed by Hollande in the wake of the terrorist attacks that shook Paris on November 13. One week later, she published Murmures à la jeunesse, a book about this proposal.
Taubira was married twice. She has four children with her second husband, Roland Delannon. They are divorced. Delannon is a separatist politician who founded the Decolonization and Social Emancipation Movement; he was jailed for 18 months for planning to blow up an oil and gas facility in the 1980s.
