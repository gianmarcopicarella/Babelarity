Televisión Española (acronym TVE, on lowercase letters: tve, in English "Spanish Television") is the national state-owned public-service television broadcaster in Spain. TVE belongs to the RTVE Corporation which has overall responsibility for national public-service radio and television under a Parliament-appointed General Manager who, as well as being answerable to a Board of Directors, reports to an all-party committee of the national parliament, as provided for in the Public Radio and Television Law of 2006.
TVE's activities were previously financed by a combination of advertising revenue and subsidies from the national government, but since January 2010 it has been supported by subsidies only.
Both the international channel and La 1 have regular news-bulletins marketed under the Telediario name; Telediario has three editions: the breakfast edition, 15:00 (local time) edition and 21:00 edition. La 1 also broadcasts regional news bulletins at 14:00. La 2 also has its own national news bulletin, "La 2 Noticias" ("The 2 News"), which began as an original nightly news bulletin in the late-80s but it was turned into a breakfast news-programme in the mid-1990s and was later revamped as a nightly news bulletin, reverting to its original timeslot at 22:00. In 2015, La 2 Noticias moved to a later timeslot, 01:05.
