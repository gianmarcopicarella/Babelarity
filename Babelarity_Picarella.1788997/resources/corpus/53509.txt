On 3 February 2013, the then Prime Minister, Kamla Persad-Bissessar announced that the ruling party would nominate Carmona to succeed outgoing President George Maxwell Richards. The following day, Dr. Keith Rowley, leader of the People's National Movement (PNM), indicated that his party supported Carmona's nomination. However, following this announcement, the People's National Movement (PNM) questioned Carmona's eligibility to serve as President, given his work outside the country between 2001 and 2004. (To be eligible to be elected President, a person must be "ordinarily resident" in the country for the ten years prior to election.) Former Attorney General, Anand Ramlogan responded by saying that the then government had consulted with legal experts who expressed the opinion that Carmona met this requirement.
