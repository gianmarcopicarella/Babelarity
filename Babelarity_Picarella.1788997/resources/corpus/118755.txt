1257 Móra, provisional designation 1932 PE, is an assumed stony asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, about 21 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at Heidelberg Observatory on 8 August 1932.
The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.3–2.7 AU once every 3 years and 11 months (1,434 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.08 and is tilted by 4 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. It has a rotation period of 5.3 hours and an albedo of 0.10 and 0.05, as observed by the space-based Japanese Akari and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer satellites, respectively. However, the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL) assumes the body to be a stony S-type asteroid with a higher albedo of 0.20 and to have a diameter, that measures only about 11 kilometers.
The minor planet was named in honour of Hungarian astronomer Kráoly Móra. The minor planet 2517 Orma – where "omra" stands for the Italian "to track/to trace" – was later named by Paul Wild in 1968 based on an alphanumerical variation (or simply an inversion of letters and numbers) of the asteroid "1257 Mora". The Minor Planet Center's naming citations and D. Schmadel's Dictionary of Minor Planets do not provide any further information on specific details about this curiosity.
