Conraua is a genus of large frogs from sub-Saharan Africa. They are sometimes known as slippery frogs. Conraua is the only genus in the Conrauidae family. Alternatively, it may be placed in the Petropedetidae family.
This genus includes the largest frog of the world, Conraua goliath, which may grow to 32 cm (13 in) in snout–vent length and weigh as much as 3.3 kg (7.3 lb). Four of the six species in this genus are threatened.
The name of the genus honours Gustav Conrau, a German trader and labour recruiter in Cameroon and the collector of the holotype of Conraua robusta, the type species of the genus.
The recognized species are:
Conraua alleni (Barbour & Loveridge, 1927)
Conraua beccarii (Boulenger, 1911)
Conraua crassipes (Buchholz & Peters in Peters, 1875)
Conraua derooi Hulselmans, 1972
Conraua goliath (Boulenger, 1906) — goliath frog
Conraua robusta Nieden, 1908 — giant slippery frog
