Hobart is home to Lake George, a popular place for people to gather to walk along the city's waterfront. Musical entertainment can be found near the clock tower in Lakefront Park and at the Revelli Bandshell during the warm months. Fishing and boating are two popular activities at Lake George. At Festival Park, people are often seen to feed the plentiful ducks that live there. In the past, fishermen fished at Hobart's Robinson Lake. As of October 2006, Former Mayor Linda Buzenic announced the "highest and best use" for Robinson Lake would be to put it up for sale, according to the Post-Tribune.
The city features 14 parks, 2 public 18-hole golf courses (Cressmoor Country Club closed in 2006 leaving 1), and many sports fields for basketball, football, baseball, soccer, rugby, and many other sports. The city recently bought an outdoor swimming pool.
Lake George, formed by the damming of Deep River, is a medium-sized lake that winds its way through Hobart. Once a wild and pristine environment rich with native wildlife, non-native species such as the dozens of domesticated ducks and geese and Eurasian mute swans released here by people over the years, as well as artificially high amounts of food due to feedings have produced an environment that holds far more animals than the area could ever naturally sustain. At Festival Park, the one-hundred to two-hundred or so resident birds (which include virtually-flightless domesticated birds, swans, mallards and Canada geese that cannot or do not migrate, and hybrids of all types) that live at the lake year round, as well as migrant Canada geese and mallards, have stripped the shoreline and land of most vegetation, resulting in erosion, and have turned the shallow lake below the dam into little more than a muddy broth of bacteria. The waters, however, are very fertile and as a result one-hundred pound channel catfish have been caught at Festival park. The Oak Savannah rails-to-trails route cuts through the city and offers biking and hiking. The Oak Savannah trail passes by the 90-acre (360,000 m2) Hobart Prairie Grove Unit of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore.
The Shirley Heinze Land Trust, Inc. owns other nature preserves in the city of Hobart, including a tallgrass prairie. The Cressmoor Prairie is a dedicated state nature preserve, and is the largest state-protected rare "black soil" or silt-loam prairie in Indiana.
The city's Mundell Field has a quarter-mile outdoor oval track for walking.
Hobart is home to one of Indiana's largest indoor shopping malls: Westfield Southlake, located in the southern part of the city near the intersection of US 30 and Interstate 65. The area is filled with outdoor strip malls that contain over 200 stores and restaurants.
Hobart residents drive 15 minutes west-northwest to visit casino boats on Lake Michigan and 15 minutes northeast to visit the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore and the Indiana Dunes State Park, containing 15,000 acres (61 km2) of beaches, sand dunes, bogs, and protected wildlife.
Hobart is home to many thriving businesses in its downtown shopping district, including the historic Art Theatre.
Hobart is also home to the Westfield Southlake Shopping Mall and many surrounding retailers and restaurants, although most businesses are required to list their addresses as Merrillville.

Most of the city is within the School City of Hobart, although other parts of the city are within the River Forest Community School Corporation or the Merrillville Community School District. Hobart High School students are referred to as the "Brickies," in reference to the brickyards that were once located on city's northern side near Cressmore Prairie. The school mascot is named Yohan and bears a strong resemblance to "Boilermaker Pete" from Purdue University. Hobart High School at one time was considered a leader in music education; in the early twentieth century, its band won national Sousa band competitions under the direction of William Revelli, who later left to lead the University of Michigan band. The city is also home to Trinity Lutheran School, a pre-school through 8th grade parochial school and Montessori Academy in the Oaks.
The Merrillville section is served by John Wood Elementary School and the feeder schools in Merrillville.
