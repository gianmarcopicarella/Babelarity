Note that some mayors in cities with an official mayor's residence choose instead to reside at their private residence, using the official residence for official functions only. This has occurred in the 21st century in Detroit and New York City, although as of 2016 the mayors of both cities live in the official residences. In the case of Denver, no mayor has ever lived in the official residence; the city instead makes it available to certain non-profit groups for special functions.
