Burlingame is a city in San Mateo County, California. It is located on the San Francisco Peninsula and has a significant shoreline on San Francisco Bay. An early suburb of San Francisco, the city is named after diplomat Anson Burlingame and is often referred to as the City of Trees due to the number of trees within the city and its numerous eucalyptus groves. Burlingame is known for its high residential quality of life with an excellent public school system. The current median home value in Burlingame is $1,800,000+ and as of the 2010 U.S. Census, Burlingame had a population of 28,807.
Burlingame is on the Mexican land grant Rancho San Mateo given by Governor Pio Pico to his secretary, Cayetano Arena in 1845. Cayetano soon sold the land to San Francisco-based merchant William Davis Merry Howard. Howard retired to live on the rancho for the remaining eight years of his life. Howard planted many eucalyptus trees on his property.
Howard's early death in 1856 led to the sale of most of the land to William C. Ralston, a prominent banker. In 1866, Anson Burlingame, the US Minister to China visited Ralston, and by the time he left he was the owner of 1,043 acres (4 km2) of land. In 1868, Ralston named the settlement after his friend, Anson Burlingame. However, Burlingame would not come back to the area again because on a visit to Russia in 1870, Burlingame died. With his death the land reverted to Ralston.
Ralston had plans for the area which he called "Ralstonville", but he died in 1875 without many of his plans being realized. The land then passed to Ralston's business partner Senator William Sharon. Sharon died in 1885, and Sharon's son-in-law, Francis G. Newlands, became executor of Sharon’s estate. Newlands had grand plans of his own. His vision was to build estates that surrounded a country club, similar to the development he helped create in Chevy Chase, Maryland. The Burlingame Country Club was organized in 1893.
After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, many people looking to escape the hardships of a city in ruins flocked south. Hundreds of lots in Burlingame were sold in 1906 and 1907. Just two years after the quake, the town of Burlingame was incorporated June 6, 1908. By 1910, the neighboring town of Easton, on the former Rancho Buri Buri, was annexed and became part of Burlingame as well.
City of Trees
Burlingame is known as the "City of Trees" due to the number of trees within the city (18,000 public trees). In 1908, the Burlingame board of trustees passed an ordinance "prohibiting cutting, injuring, or destroying trees". Most residential properties have trees owned and protected by the city on their public right of way. In addition the city has many parks and Eucalyptus groves that add to the overall tree numbers. The Eucalyptus groves are west of the city on Interstate 280 and grow along many city streets, such as the heritage Jules Francard Grove along the Caltrain tracks north of Burlingame Avenue, following El Camino Real, and along other smaller local streets, such as Burlingame Avenue. Washington Park, with Burlingame Avenue at its southern edge, Burlingame High School at its northern edge, and the Caltrain line at its western edge is the oldest park in Burlingame. It was originally part of the estate of millionaire cigar retailer Moses A. Gunst, and some of the existing large trees within the park were part of this estate.
There are four highways passing through Burlingame. Highway 101 runs near the bay, coming from San Jose and going to San Francisco. Highway 82, also known as El Camino Real, follows a parallel course. Highway 35 connects with Interstate 280.
Caltrain has been serving Burlingame since 1985 when it bought out Southern Pacific. It used the same depot that was used in the early 20th century. It was labeled Burlingame, for the country club. In the early 2000s (decade), Caltrain reduced the service at the station on Broadway from a daily basis to weekend-only service.
Bay Area Rapid Transit has its final stop in Millbrae, just north of Burlingame. BART's tracks are within Burlingame city limits.
