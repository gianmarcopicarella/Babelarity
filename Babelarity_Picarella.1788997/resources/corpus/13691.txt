Omari Mikhailovich Tetradze (Russian: Омари Михайлович Тетрадзе) (born 13 October 1969 as Omari Mikhailovich Osipov) is a Georgian former football player of Caucasus Greek descent who, during his playing career, represented Russia at international level. He manages FC Tobol.
Known as Omari Osipov until the age of 18, he decided to change surname when he turned professional. It was the run-up to the USSR breakup and the nationalist sentiments in Georgia were strong enough to affect the young player's career. Because of that, Omari took his maternal grandmother's Georgian surname – Tetradze. Later he considered restoring his original surname, but decided it would cause too many problems.
At club level, he played for Dinamo Tbilisi, FC Dynamo Moscow, Alania Vladikavkaz (where he won a Russian league championship medal in 1995), AS Roma, and PAOK FC (Greece).

He played for Russia at international level, and appeared at USA 94 and Euro 96. At the latter tournament, he played superbly in each of Russia's three games despite the team's poor results, and was arguably the best right-back in the competition.
After finishing his playing career in 2005, he became an assistant coach at Krylia Sovetov Samara. He was later the manager of Anzhi Makhachkala. He threatened to resign the post in September 2008 following a 1–0 defeat against Belgorod, but subsequently stayed on as manager. Anzhi finally returned to Russian Premier League for 2010 season after finishing champion in First Division. On 19 March 2010 the Coach has quit Anzhi Makhachkala.
In September 2014, Tetradze and his coaching staff left FC Zhetysu by mutual consent.
In the early 1990s he received Greek citizenship but later renounced it. Tetradze considers himself to be a Greek by ethnicity, but says Georgia is his homeland.
