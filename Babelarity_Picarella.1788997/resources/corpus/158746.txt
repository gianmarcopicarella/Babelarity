The city of Fritch is primarily a bedroom community with the majority of citizens commuting to nearby Borger and Amarillo for work. Major employers in the area include Pantex, ConocoPhillips and Agrium, all located with a short distance of Fritch. Due to its nature as a commuting town, Fritch differs from most small towns in the region which rely more on agriculture as their economic base. Though there are several large ranches adjacent to the town, there is little to no farming due to the uneven topography, and the town has no agriculture-related services to speak of.
Fritch is located adjacent to the Lake Meredith National Recreation Area offering residents and visitors ample opportunities for outdoor activities including boating, fishing, camping, hiking, and seasonal hunting. Alibates Flint Quarries National Monument is also located near the city. The town is also home to the Lake Meredith Historical Museum.
