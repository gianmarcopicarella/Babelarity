James Rossiter (born 25 August 1983) is a professional racing driver from England. He is currently driving for TOM'S in Super GT and in Super Formula. Previously he was an F1 test driver for the Honda, Super Aguri and Force India Formula One teams. He has participated in karting, Formula Renault, British Formula 3 and Formula 3 Euro Series. His father, Jeremy, was also a racing driver.
Born in Oxford, Rossiter started his race career at 14 when he started Karting in TKM and Rotax Max karts and within 3 years, in 2001, he graduated to single seaters initially testing a Formula Palmer Audi at the Bedford Autodrome. Rossiter then graduated to Formula Renault testing and racing with Falcon Motorsport in 2002. He moved to Fortec Motorsport for 2003 and finished third in the British Formula Renault Championship after a race winning season. Rossiter was recognised by a leading journalist as "the only driver to take the fight to Lewis Hamilton".
In 2004 Rossiter stayed with the Fortec Motorsport team and graduated to the British Formula 3 Championship, winning three races and the British Formula 3 Avon tyres rookie of the year award. Rossiter also competed at the Macau Formula Three Grand Prix and the Masters of Formula 3 events. His performances also led to Rossiter winning the BRDC John Cooper Award and being selected as the winner of the BAR young F1 driver search selected from a group of upcoming drivers, several now being established F1 racers.
In 2005, Rossiter left Britain and went into the Formula 3 Euro Series with Signature-Plus supporting him; he finished 7th in the series, winning in wet conditions the second race of the year at the Hockenheimring. He was also added to the roster of the BAR team development drivers. For 2006, Rossiter moved up to the World Series by Renault with Pons Racing, combining racing with his Formula One testing duties.
For 2007, Rossiter was retained as one of Honda's test and development drivers with his main work being with the Super Aguri F1 team.
Honda retained Rossiter for the 2008 season as their primary test and development driver for their Formula One program, mainly working with the team in Japan. During this time he played a part in developing the Honda RA109 which would become the BGP 001, which Jenson Button drove to the 2009 Formula One World Drivers' Championship title. Through his Honda connections Rossiter competed and won in the American Le Mans Series for Acura with Andretti Green Racing.
After leaving Honda he spent 2009 trying to secure a Formula One drive with one of the four new teams entering in the 2010 season.
Rossiter was signed by US F1 to race in the 2010 Formula One season; however it wasn't officially confirmed before the team collapsed. Rossiter was expected to join the IZOD IndyCar Series in 2010, driving for KV Racing Technology, after testing for the team at Barber Motorsports Park. However the team re-signed Mario Moraes, leaving him without a drive for the year. He then joined Sky Sports as a commentator for their coverage of IndyCar. He also drove in the Evora Cup with Lotus.
Rossiter is currently a lead test and development driver working on the Lotus T-125 track day car. His relationship with Lotus Cars has put him back in the frame for a drive in IndyCar with KV Racing Technology, who are now backed and sponsored by Lotus Cars, although it is likely to be only part-time.
In 2011, he drove in the 1000 km of Spa as part of the Le Mans Series, and retired after 21 laps. He also took part in the 24 Hours of Le Mans driving a Lotus Evora GTE, finishing 22nd overall, 7th in the GTE class, and 3rd in the International Le Mans Cup standings.
Mid way through the 2012 Formula One season he was signed by Force India as a test and simulator driver, and he drove the VJM06 at the first pre-season test in Jerez in 2013.
