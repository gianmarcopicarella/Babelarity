Lots of evidence has been found of ancient life in this small town, but it wasnâ€™t until the Middle Ages that life had been actually documented in this particular district of Madrid. After the Reconquista, Hoyo de Manzanares was quickly repopulated by Moriscos, Philistines, Segovians and of course Madridians. This mixed population remained as it was, until 1609 to 1614 where the Spanish government forced Moriscos to leave the kingdom of Spain after the marriage of the queen of Castille, Isabel, and the King of Aragon, Ferdinand. The town then lost most of its population, but remained constant for the following years.
