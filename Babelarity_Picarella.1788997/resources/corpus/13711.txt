Marcos Luis Rocha Aquino or simply Marcos Rocha (born 11 December 1988), is a Brazilian footballer who plays for Atlético Mineiro as a right back.
Born in Sete Lagoas, Minas Gerais, Marcos Rocha joined Atlético Mineiro's youth setup in 2005, from hometown's Bela Vista FC. He was promoted to the main squad in 2008, but made his senior debuts while on loan at Uberlândia EC.
Marcos Rocha made his professional debuts late in the year, representing CRB also in a temporary deal. He returned to Atlético in January 2009, mainly as a backup to Sheslon; after the latter's injury he made his debut for Galo, starting in a 3–0 away win against Social on 7 February 2009, for the Campeonato Mineiro championship.
Marcos Rocha made his Série A debut on 16 May 2009, replacing Jonílson in the 82nd minute of a 2–1 home win against Grêmio. He appeared in ten matches during the campaign, scoring once (against Avaí on 20 August).
On 25 February 2010 Marcos Rocha was loaned to Ponte Preta. After appearing sparingly he moved to América Mineiro, featuring regularly over the course of nearly two years.
On 30 November 2011, it was confirmed that Marcos Rocha would return to Atlético. He was immediately elected as first-choice, and was among the squad which won the state league twice, the Copa Libertadores in 2013, and the Recopa Sudamericana and Copa do Brasil in 2014.
