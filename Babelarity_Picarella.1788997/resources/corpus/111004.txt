Vladivoj (c. 981 – January 1003) was duke of Bohemia from 1002 to his death. He was probably a Přemyslid, possibly a second son of Doubravka of Bohemia, or a distant relative. Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia was dethroned and the Bohemian lords made Vladivoj, who had earlier fled to Poland, duke in 1002. The Czech historian Dušan Třeštík writes that Vladivoj seized the Bohemian throne with Bolesław's assistance. After Vladivoj died in 1003, Bolesław invaded Bohemia and restored Boleslaus III who had many Bohemian noblemen murdered. It is said that Vladivoj was an alcoholic, and alcohol was a possible contributor to his death.
