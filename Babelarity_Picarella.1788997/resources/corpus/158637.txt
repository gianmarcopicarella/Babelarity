Inhumas was important as a stopping point on the Estrada Real linking the south with Goiás Velho. The first settlement was called Goiabeiras, because of the extensive groves of guava trees. It had fertile soil and attracted many immigrants, especially Syrians and Lebanese (Asmar, Sahium, Raiza, Chalub, Mahmud, Gebrim, Charter, Sebba, Nacruht), Italians (Pessoni, Qualhato, Serravali, Balestra, Quintanilha, Jácomo) and Japanese (Watanabe, Momonuke). The Syrian-Lebanese were the first to open commercial establishments in the 1930s. The Italians cultivated coffee and the Japanese worked on small farms producing garden vegetables. At one time the region was a major producer of coffee.
In 1896 Goiabeiras was elevated to the status of district in the municipality of Itaberaí. In 1908 the name was changed to "Inhumas" in homage to a local bird also known as inhuma or anhuma (Anhima cornuta) In 1931 Inhumas was dismembered from Itaberaí to become a municipality.
