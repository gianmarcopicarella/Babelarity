It organizes the Paraguayan football league and the Paraguay national football team, and is based in the Paraguayan capital, Asunción. In 1906, the representatives of the five existing football teams in Paraguay at that time (Olimpia, Guaraní, Libertad, General Díaz, and Nacional) met to create the governing body of football in Paraguay, the Paraguayan Football League. In 1998 its name was changed to its current denomination.
