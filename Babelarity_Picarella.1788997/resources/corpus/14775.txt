Takeshi Matsuda (松田 丈志, Matsuda Takeshi, born June 23, 1984 in Nobeoka, Miyazaki) is a Japanese Olympic and Asian and National Record holding swimmer. He swam for Japan at the 2004, 2008 Olympics, and 2012 Olympics. At the latter event, he won a bronze medal in the men's 200m long course butterfly in an Asian Record of 1:52.97; in doing so, he also set the Japanese Record in the event. On November 12, 2011, Matsuda set a new Japanese record (1:49.50) at the FINA World Cup for the short course 200m butterfly. In doing so, he became just the third swimmer in history to break the 1:50 barrier for the event. Kaio Almeida (1:49.11) and Nikolay Skvortsov (1:49.46) hold the other two spots.
Matsuda began swimming at the age of 4 at a local pool in Nobeoka, Miyazaki, Japan, a relatively rural town with little history in swimming. Since then, he has trained with the same coach, Yumiko Kuze, a rare female coach in the world of men's swimming. She was a swimmer in her youth and began as a volunteer coach at the local pool (personal interview).
At the 2004 Olympic Games, Matsuda placed 8th in the 400m Freestyle final.
In the final of the men's 200m butterfly at the 2008 Olympics, he finished 3rd to claim bronze. He came behind Michael Phelps and László Cseh, with a time of 1:52.97, an Asian record.
At the 2012 Olympics, Matsuda won two medals. He defended his bronze medal in the 200 meter butterfly and swam the butterfly leg for Japan's silver medal-winning relay team in the 4 × 100 meter medley relay with Ryosuke Irie, Kosuke Kitajima, and Takuro Fujii. He also swam the 100 meter butterfly, where he tied for sixteenth in the heats and subsequently lost a swim-off with Benjamin Starke of Germany, shutting him out of the semifinals.
