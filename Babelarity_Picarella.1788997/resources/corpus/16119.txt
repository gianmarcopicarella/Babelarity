Nancy followed one week later after a 2–1 home defeat to Bastia on 18 May 2013 ending 8 years of top-flight tenure. Finally Troyes were relegated from the top level after a 2–1 away defeat to Valenciennes on 26 May 2013.
These relegated team were replaced by Ligue 2 champions AS Monaco, runners-up Guingamp, and third-placed Nantes. Monaco clinched the second division title on 11 May 2013 with two matches to spare after defeating Nîmes 1–0 at away. Monaco is making its return to the first division after a two-year absence.
Guingamp and Nantes became the second and third clubs, respectively, to earn promotion to Ligue 1 alongside the champion Monaco. Both clubs achieved promotion with one game to spare following league victories on 17 May 2013. Guingamp is returning to the first division after 9 years. During its nine-year spell outside the first division Guingamp also played in Championnat National in the 2010–11 season.
