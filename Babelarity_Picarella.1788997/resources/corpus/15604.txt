Mario Matt (born 9 April 1979) is an Austrian former World Cup alpine ski racer and Olympic gold medalist. He is widely considered as one of the best slalom racers of all time.
Born in Flirsch, Tyrol, Matt made his World Cup debut in December 1999. He won 15 World Cup victories: 14 in slalom and one super combined. Matt is also a two-time world champion in slalom, with titles in 2001 and 2007. With a remarkably long career as a top slalom racer, he is the oldest to win an Olympic gold medal in alpine skiing (in Sochi at the 2014 Winter olympics) and the oldest to win a World Cup slalom race. Matt also has the third longest time interval between first and last World Cup victories (13 years, 10 months, and 22 days), after Ingemar Stenmark and Didier Cuche.
Matt announced his retirement from ski racing on March 12, 2015.
15 wins – (14 SL, 1 SC)
