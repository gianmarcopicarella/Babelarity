Rana amurensis (Khabarovsk frog, Siberian wood frog, Heilongjiang brown frog or Amur brown frog) is a species of true frog found in northern Asia. It ranges across western Siberia, as well as northeastern China, northeastern Mongolia, and on the northern Korean Peninsula and on Sakhalin. Rana coreana was previously included in this species as a subspecies.
According to the IUCN, the chief threat to the species is habitat loss, as it is only mildly tolerant of disturbance. In addition, it has become a frequent subject of hunting in Russia since the 1990s. It is not considered threatened on a global scale though.
Favoring lowlands, it is seldom encountered at elevations of more than 600 m. A habitat generalist, Rana amurensis favors open ground, but is also found in both deciduous and coniferous forests. In the winter, it hibernates on pond bottoms. Adults are light brown with smooth skin and irregular dark brown and yellow stripes, with a body length of 2–2.5 cm (0.79–0.98 in).
Rana amurensis favors beetles, and consumes 1.2–2.5 g (0.0026–0.0055 lb) of food per day. The average lifespan is three years. A 2004 study estimated the Siberian tree frogs consume approximately 450 g (0.99 lb) of invertebrates in the course of their lives, of which beetles make up more than 65%. Their breeding season is very early, starting in late February in Korea. An egg sac contains 30-60 eggs.
