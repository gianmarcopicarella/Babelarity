Frederick V of Nuremberg (before 3 March 1333 – 21 January 1398) was a Burgrave (Burggraf) of Nuremberg, of the House of Hohenzollern.
He was the elder son of John II of Nuremberg and Elisabeth of Henneberg. From the death of his father in 1357, Frederick bore the title of Burgrave and so was responsible for the protection of the strategically significant imperial castle of Nuremberg. His zeal in the imperial cause led Charles IV to elevate him in 1363 to be the first Burgrave of royal rank.
After his death, his sons divided their inheritance. The eldest son, John III became the first Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach. Johann's brother Frederick VI became the next Burgrave of Nuremberg as well as the first Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach. Frederick VI went on to become the first Hohenzollern Elector of Brandenburg.
He married in 1350 Elisabeth of Meissen, daughter of Frederick II, Margrave of Meissen and Matilda of Bavaria. Their children were:
