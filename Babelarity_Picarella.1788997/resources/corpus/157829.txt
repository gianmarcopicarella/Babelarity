Mustafakemalpaşa is the main town of Bursa Province in the Marmara region of Turkey.

The ancient Greek name of the county was Kremaste (Κρεμαστή in Ancient greek, Kirmasti in modern Turkish), under the Kingdom of Bithynia. Around 300AD the town became important when it became a Christian diocese. In 1336 the town was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire. It was devastated in 1920 during the Greco-Turkish war. After the War of Independence, led by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the Town Council decided to rename the city Mustafakemalpaşa in his honor. The town currently has 56,727 residents.
