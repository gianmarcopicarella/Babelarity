Chengdu Metro is the local mass rapid train transportation system in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, China. The system has three lines: Line 1 was constructed between December 2005 and 2010, and opened at Sep 27th, making it the first heavy-rail metro line in south and west China. (Chongqing Rail Transit Line 2 opened first in 2005 but is Heavy-Monorail); and Line 2 began operations in September 2012. Line 4 opened to public at the end of December 2015. Metro lines are operated by Chengdu Metro Limited Liability Company. And city commuting train lines including Chengdupu Line and Chengpeng Line are operated by Chengdu City Commuting Railway Limited Liability Company.
The Chengdu Metro System consists of three parts: the Metro and the City Railway, as well as the Light Rail Train. It is China's first joint venture between a local government and China's national rail operator. The city and the Ministry of Railways worked together in building metro lines and high speed commuting rail lines. The light rail began construction at October 2015, and will open to public in 2017.
Chengdu Metro's first subway line, Line 1, started construction on December 28, 2005.
Construction of Line 2 began on 29 December 2007.
Line 1 opened on 27 September 2010.
Line 4 started construction on 22 July 2011.
On 25 April 2012, Line 3 was approved by the Development and Reform Commission
On 16 January 2012, the National Development and Reform Commission officially approved the southern extension of Line 1.
On 28 April 2012, Line 3 started construction.
On 8 June 2013, Line 2 West Extension to Xipu, and Ocean Park Station on Line 1 was opened. Ocean Park was then renamed to Jincheng Plaza.
On 26 October 2014, Line 2 East Extension to Longquanyi opened.
On 25 July 2015, Line 1 South Extension was opened.
On December 10, 2015, Line 4 phase 1 was opened.
There will be five lines constructed in the first phase, covering 126 km with 116 stations including 11 interchange stations. Line 1 has 17 stations at along the 18.50 kilometre route, starting at Shengxian Lake and ending at Century City. Line 2 has 26 stations along the 31.20 kilometre route, starting at Xipu and ending at Chengdu Institute of Administration.
The first phase of Line 1 cost 7 billion yuan to construct. A natural ventilation system has been used in the construction of the underground section of Line 1 on the subway system from Southern Third Ring Road to Chengdu New Exhibition and Convention Center. Square ventilation units are built every 30m along the subway top to allow fresh air from the ground enter the construction site underground. The method is used in subway construction in other countries as it cuts the construction cost and it saves energy. The subway system is the first in China to adopt such a ventilation system during construction. Chengdu Metro is planning to set up a section for subway fire control and introduce the latest fire fighting technologies and vehicles.
Line 2 is a crosstown northwest-southeast trunk route. It serves the Chengdu East Railway Station. Line 2 began operation on 16 September 2012.
Line 4 is a crosstown east-west trunk route, serving the Chengdu West Railway Station. It started operation on 26 December 2015.
There will be 22 B size sets of three cars each when the line opens, made by CSR. The trains will be air-conditioned and can hold up to a maximum of 1,200 people. The cars will be 2.8m wide and 19m long. In the future, trains will be expanded to five cars. The rolling stock's average train speed will be 35 km/h and its maximum speed will be 80 km/h. The metro system will be equipped with Automatic Train Protection, Automatic Train Control, Automatic Train Stop and Automatic Train Operation. Fire alarms, on-train/track systems, and automatic fare collection systems will also be installed. A minimum curve radius of 400m will be used where possible, though some restricted areas will have a curve radius of 300m. The maximum gradient will be 35%, and the railway tracks will be laid to standard gauge (1435mm) using 60 kg/m rail, allowing a maximum speed of 80 km/h. The power supply will be 750 V DC with third rail collection and running rail return.
In April 2011, a further order was announced for trains from CSR, taking the total to 354 units.
Seven lines are planned to be constructed over the next thirty years and five have been planned so far, with all around the city centre. When the whole of Line 1 is completed, it will have reached a length of 31.6 km with 22.44 km of underground tracks and 9.16 km of tracks at either ground level or elevated with 23 stations. There will be a depot at Huayang, two main substations, ten traction substations and one control centre. Line 1 will interchange with Chengdu Railway Station and Chengdu South Railway Stations.
Line 3 is currently under construction and expected to be finished before the end of 2016, while Extensions of Line 4 in both directions are expected to open in 2017. Line 7 is expected to start construction before the end of 2012 with a 2015 target completion date, but was pushed back to 2017. In 2020, it is expected that Chengdu will build about 291 km of subway lines.
In planning, Line 6 phase 1, 2 and line 18 phase 2 are expected to start construction in 2016.
Also in planning, Line 9, line 11 and line 17 are expected to start construction in 2017.
