Max Rudolf (June 15, 1902 — February 28, 1995) was a German conductor who spent most of his career in the United States.
Rudolf was born in Frankfurt am Main where he studied cello, piano, organ, trumpet, and composition (with Bernhard Sekles) at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt. He held positions in Freiburg, Darmstadt, and Prague, before moving to the United States in 1940. In 1945, he became a naturalized citizen. He served on the conducting staff of the Metropolitan Opera between 1946 and 1958, when he became music director of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra for 13 years. During this period he became a noted orchestra builder and teacher, serving on the staff of the Tanglewood Institute. He wrote The Grammar of Conducting, the most widely used text for orchestral conducting. First appearing in 1950, it was republished with significant revisions in 1980 and again in 1995.
After his tenure in Cincinnati, he served as conductor of the Dallas Symphony for a season (1973–74), artistic advisor of the New Jersey Symphony (1976–77), as well as regular engagements with major American orchestras and opera houses. In between this time, he was head of the opera and conducting department at the Curtis Institute of Music (1970–73 and 1983–89), which is perhaps what he is best remembered for, since many of the leading conductors of this day studied under him.
