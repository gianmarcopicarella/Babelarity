Potassium bisulfate is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula KHSO4 and is the potassium acid salt of sulfuric acid.
Mercallite, the mineralogical form of potassium bisulfate, occurs very rarely. Misenite is another, more complex, form of potassium bisulfate.
Potassium bisulfate is prepared by neutralizing sulfuric acid with an equal molar amount of a potassium containing base, for example potassium hydroxide:
H2SO4 + KOH → KHSO4 + H2O
Potassium bisulfate is also formed by the union of sulfuric acid with potassium sulfate:
H2SO4 + K2SO4 → 2 KHSO4
Potassium bisulfate is also the main by-product in the production of nitric acid from potassium nitrate and sulfuric acid:
KNO3 + H2SO4 → KHSO4 + HNO3
Thermal decomposition of potassium bisulfate forms potassium pyrosulfate and water:
2 KHSO4 → K2S2O7 + H2O
Temperatures above 600°C further decompose potassium bisulfate to potassium sulfate and sulfur trioxide:
KHSO4 → K2SO4 + SO3 + H2O
Aqueous solutions of potassium bisulfate behave as two separate, uncombined compounds, K2SO4 and H2SO4. Adding ethanol to the solution precipitates out potassium sulfate.
Potassium bisulfate is commonly used to prepare potassium bitartrate for winemaking. Potassium bisulfate is also used as a disintegrating agent in analytical chemistry or as a precursor to prepare potassium persulfate, a powerful oxidizing agent.
