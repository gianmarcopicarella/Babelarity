Troy Hudson (born March 13, 1976) is an American retired professional basketball point guard who last played with the Sioux Falls Skyforce of the NBA Development League.
After a college career at the University of Missouri and Southern Illinois University that finished in his junior year, Hudson was not selected in the 1997 NBA draft, and played his first season in the Continental Basketball Association. After earning a hard-fought spot on the Utah Jazz in 1998, which only lasted two months, he later played for the Los Angeles Clippers (also playing during the short-lived 1999 season in the CBA) and the Orlando Magic, where he first developed into an important player, averaging 12 points and 3 assists per game during 2001-02, while appearing in 81 games.
However, Hudson's most productive seasons came with the Minnesota Timberwolves, where he averaged a career-best 14.2 pts and 5.7 assists in 2002-03, also receiving the nickname "Laker Killer" for his outstanding postseason play against the Los Angeles Lakers, where he increased his numbers to 23.5 points in a 2-4 first-round loss.
After landing a lucrative contract extension in 2003, Hudson was plagued by nagging injuries that subsequently hurt his production, as he only appeared in 70 games from 2005-07 combined. His contract with the Timberwolves was bought out on August 3, 2007.
Originally signed to the Golden State Warriors on September 24, 2007, Hudson appeared in only nine games in the 2007-08 season. Following hip surgery on January 10, 2008, he was waived by the Warriors on January 29, to make room for Chris Webber, averaging 9.0 points per game throughout his NBA career.
On October 31, 2012, Hudson signed with the Sioux Falls Skyforce of the NBA D-League. After struggling with injuries, he decided to retire at the end of January 2013.
Hudson released one major album, Undrafted, also having recorded around 800 songs. A drum machine usually accompanies him on road trips. "I have my own label — Nutty Boyz Entertainment — and I have three artists (that I manage)", he said in an interview. However, the albums were not big sellers, with Hudson only selling 78 copies of his own in its first week of sales.However the album went on the move over 100k
