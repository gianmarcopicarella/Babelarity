Phylloquinone, also Vitamin K1, is a polycyclic aromatic ketone, based on 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, with a 3-phytyl substituent.
It is a fat-soluble vitamin that is stable to air and moisture but decomposes in sunlight. It is found naturally in a wide variety of green plants, particularly leaves, since it functions as an electron acceptor during photosynthesis, forming part of the electron transport chain of Photosystem I.
It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, a list of the most important medication needed in a basic health system.
It is often called vitamin K, phytomenadione or phytonadione. Sometimes a distinction is made with phylloquinone considered natural and phytonadione considered synthetic.
A stereoisomer of phylloquinone is called vitamin k1 (note the difference in capitalization).
Phylloquinone is an electron acceptor during photosynthesis, forming part of the electron transport chain of Photosystem I.
Its best-known function in animals is as a cofactor in the formation of coagulation factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X by the liver. It is also required for the formation of anticoagulant factors protein C and S. It is commonly used to treat warfarin toxicity, and as an antidote for coumatetralyl.
Vitamin K is required for bone protein formation.
