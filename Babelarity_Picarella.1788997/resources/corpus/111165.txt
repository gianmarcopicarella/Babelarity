Yolande of France (23 September 1434 – 23 August 1478) was a Duchess consort of Savoy. She was a daughter of King Charles VII of France, "The Victorious," and Marie of Anjou. She married Duke Amadeus IX of Savoy in 1452. She was named after her grandmother, Yolande of Aragon. She is sometimes known as Yolande of France. Yolande acted as regent of Savoy in 1472-78.
Her husband's retiring disposition and epilepsy left her in control of the state, to struggle with the Savoyard barons. After his death in March 1472, she became regent for her son Philibert until her own death. Like her brother Charles, she was an ally to Charles, duke of Burgundy against her own brother Louis XI of France. After the humiliation of Burgundy at the Battle of Grandson in 1476, the duke accused her of being in league with Louis and imprisoned her. After her release, she made peace with her brother and remained on good terms with him until her death.
With Amadeus she had ten children:
Louis of Savoy (1453)
Anne of Savoy (1455–1480), married Frederick of Aragon (1452–1504), prince of Altamura
Charles of Savoy (1456–1471), Prince of Piedmont
