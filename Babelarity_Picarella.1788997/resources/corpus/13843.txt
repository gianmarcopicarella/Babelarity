Recently, the club has competed only in lower divisions of the national league, the Copa do Brasil, the regional Copa do Nordeste and the Paraíba State Championship
The main rivals of Treze are Botafogo (PB) and Campinense.
The club own the Presidente Vargas stadium, which has a theoretical capacity of 12,000, but an approved capacity of 3,800. Games are often played at the state-owned stadium Amigão.
The club was founded on September 7, 1925 by Antônio Fernandes Bioca and twelve other football fans. The group usually played football at a field which is now João Pessoa street. Antônio Fernandes Bioca introduced football to Paraíba, after bringing the first football to the state.
In 1925, Treze's first team was José Rodolfo, José Casado, Alberto Santos, Zacarias Ribeiro "Cotó" and Plácido Veras "Guiné", Eurico, Zacarias do Ó, José Eloy, Olívio Barreto, Osmundo Lima and José de Castro.
Treze's first official match was played on 1 May 1926, at Campo dos Currais, which is now the site of a public market. Treze beat Palmeiras, an established team from the state capital João Pessoa, 1-0. Plácido Veras (known as Guiné), one of the thirteen founders of the club, scored the goal, to become the scorer of the first official Treze goal.
In 1939, Treze became the first team from outside the metropolitan region of João Pessoa to enter the Campeonato Paraibano. They won their first title in 1940 and have a total of 15 championship titles.
In 1966, Treze won the Campeonato Paraibabo undefeated, recording 12 victories and 2 draws, and conceding only 5 goals
Treze have competed in the top tier of the Brazilian football league system a total of 9 times, including the combined tournaments held in 1986, 1987 and 2000. They have competed a further 7 times in the second tier, 12 times in the third tier and 4 times in the fourth tier. They have gained promotion only once, in 2011, from Serie D, when a 5th placed finish meant they replaced Rio Branco-AC who were excluded from the competition.
In 1999, Treze were the first Paraíba State team to progress beyond the first stage of the Copa do Brasil, beating Santa Cruz. Treze lost the first leg 2-3 in Campina Grande, but then won the second leg 4-2 in Recife.
