Love at First Sting is the ninth studio album by the German rock band Scorpions. It was released on March 27, 1984 on Harvest/EMI and Mercury.
Love at First Sting is notable in that it was one of the first digitally recorded hard rock records ever released.
It became the group's most successful album in the USA, where it peaked at number 6 on the Billboard 200 chart in 1984, and went double-platinum by the end of the year, reaching triple-platinum status in 1995. The song "Rock You Like a Hurricane" reached number 25 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the same year, "Still Loving You" reached number 64 on the same chart, number 14 in Germany, number 3 in the French and Swiss Top 50.
The original cover art was created by Kochlowski, which is a German graphic design company. This cover art features a man and a partially nude woman locked in an embrace, with the man giving the woman a tattoo on her thigh. Despite the record company having shown the original cover art to retailers without any concerns, a complaint by Wal-Mart after the album was released resulted in PolyGram Records issuing a "clean" cover for use in several department store chains. The alternative cover was designed to be less controversial by simply showing a photo of the band members, which was the same photo as the one on the inner sleeve.
The album was recorded in 1983 and 1984 at Dierks Studios in Pulheim Stommeln, Germany.
All lyrics written by Klaus Meine except where noted, all music composed by Rudolf Schenker.
