The Communist Party of Argentina (Spanish: Partido Comunista de la Argentina, also simply known as "PC") is a communist party from Argentina. It was founded in 1918.
At the 2005 legislative elections, the Party joined the Encuentro Amplio with other left-wing parties in Buenos Aires and Buenos Aires Province. The coalition did badly and lost its existing national representation.
Members in the Santa Fe Province joined the Progressive, Civic and Social Front, which had its candidate, Hermes Binner (PS) elected in 2007 as governor.
The youth wing of PCA is the Communist Youth Federation.
