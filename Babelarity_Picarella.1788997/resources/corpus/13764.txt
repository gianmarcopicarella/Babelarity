The 1987–88 European Cup was the 33rd season of the European Cup club football tournament. The competition was won for the first time by PSV Eindhoven, who beat two-time winners Benfica in the final at Neckarstadion in Stuttgart, Germany. PSV became the first Dutch team to win the title in 15 years.
Porto, the defending champions, were eliminated by Real Madrid in the second round.
English clubs were still banned, following the Heysel Stadium disaster of 1985, so Everton were denied a place in the competition for the second time in three years.
1 Partizani Tirana were disqualified from the competition by UEFA because they had four players sent off in their first leg.
This game was played behind closed doors due to a UEFA ban resulting from the incidents in the match between Real Madrid and Bayern Munich the previous season.
