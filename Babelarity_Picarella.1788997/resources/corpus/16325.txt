Rui Gil Soares de Barros (born 24 November 1965) is a former Portuguese professional footballer.
A diminutive attacking midfielder, he played with success in Portugal (at Porto), Italy – at Juventus – and France (two clubs), later becoming an assistant manager.
Over the course of eight seasons Barros amassed Primeira Liga totals of 191 games and 43 goals, all with Porto.
Born in Paredes, Barros began his senior career with S.C. Covilhã in the second division, helping Varzim S.C. promote to the top flight in his second season as a professional.
Whilst at Varzim he was noticed by the Portuguese national team, and made his debut on 29 March 1987, in a 2–2 draw against minnows Malta for the UEFA Euro 1988 qualifiers, in Funchal, Madeira; he played the second half of the match.
The following campaign Barros signed with FC Porto, immediately having an impact: 12 goals in the league, which ended with the championship conquest, also being essential as the northerners began the campaign with two major achievements, the European Super Cup against AFC Ajax and the Intercontinental Cup against C.A. Peñarol; at the season's closure, the player was considered the Portuguese Footballer of the Year.
Barros joined Juventus FC from Italy in the 1988 summer, remaining with the team for two seasons. Again a leading player, he was his national team miss qualification for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, to be held precisely in that country. Afterwards he signed with AS Monaco FC of France, originally for one year (eventually three); during his spell at the club he notably lost the final of the 1991–92 European Cup Winners' Cup, to SV Werder Bremen.
In the 1993 off-season Barros moved to another club in the latter nation, Olympique de Marseille, teaming up with compatriot Paulo Futre – who left Porto for Atlético Madrid precisely the year he arrived. L'OM finished in second place, with relative participation from the player, but was relegated after a fixed results scandal.
After that sole campaign Barros returned to Porto, being an important offensive element in four of the club's five consecutive league wins. He played three more games for the national team, but was overlooked for the squad picked by manager António Oliveira for Euro 1996 in England.
Barros' last international game was a 0–0 draw with Germany in Lisbon on 14 December 1996, for the 1998 World Cup qualification stages. He quit football in June 2000, at the age of 34.
Barros stayed connected to his main club after his retirement, as a manager. After Co Adriaanse resigned in August 2006 during the preseason, he was appointed interim coach for two matches: against England's Portsmouth (2–1) and Manchester City (1–0).
Barros was also on the bench for the club's 3–0 win against Vitória de Setúbal for the domestic supercup, on 19 August 2006. Shortly afterwards Jesualdo Ferreira was appointed, and he staying as his assistant manager for the following campaigns as Porto won the league four times in a row.
A hard-working team player, Barros was known for his speed and technical ability, which allowed him to excel in Juventus' counter-attacking style of play under manager Dino Zoff. A versatile footballer, he was capable of playing in several offensive midfield and attacking positions.
