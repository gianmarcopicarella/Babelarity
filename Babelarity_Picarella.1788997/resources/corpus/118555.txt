Menkib has an apparent magnitude of +4.06 and is classified as a blue giant (spectral class O7.5III). It is approximately 1,200 light years from Earth.
It is intrinsically 12,700 times brighter than the Sun with absolute magnitude -5.5 in the V band. If the ultraviolet light that emanates from Menkib is included in its total, bolometric, luminosity is 263,000 times that of the Sun.
The star has a mass of some 30 solar masses and a surface temperature of 35,000 kelvins, making it one of the hottest stars that can be seen with the naked eye. The fluorescence of the California Nebula (NGC 1499) is due to this star’s prodigious radiation.
