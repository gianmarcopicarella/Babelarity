Calumet County is a county located in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. As of the 2010 census, the population was 48,971. The county seat is Chilton. The county was created in 1836 (then in the Wisconsin Territory) and organized in 1850.
Calumet County is included in the Appleton, WI Metropolitan Statistical Area as well as the Appleton-Oshkosh-Neenah, WI Combined Statistical Area.
The Holyland is partially located in southern Calumet County.
The county's name originated from the word calumet, the French name for the ceremonial pipes used by Native Americans in councils on the east shore of Lake Winnebago.
In the 1830s, the United States government relocated Native Americans from New York and New England to the southwest part of the county; these included the Brothertown Indians, Oneida Indians, and Stockbridge-Munsee Indians. This was a second migration for the Brothertown and Stockbridge Indians, who had moved to New York after the American Revolutionary War. The Oneida shared land on their reservation with these peoples, who had been displaced by the years of colonization in New England, warfare and disease. Each of the three groups are federally recognized with reservations in Wisconsin.
Many of the early European residents in the Holyland region in the southern part of the county were emigrants from the Schleswig-Holstein region in Germany in the 1840s.
The county was legally organized on February 5, 1850 by Chapter 84 Laws of 1850.
Calumet County figures prominently in the 2015 Netflix television series Making a Murderer, which documents the arrests and trials of Manitowoc County resident Steven Avery, which involves from 2005 the Calumet sheriff's department and district attorney's office of Ken Kratz.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 397 square miles (1,030 km2), of which 318 square miles (820 km2) is land and 79 square miles (200 km2) (20%) is water. It is the fifth-smallest county in Wisconsin by land area and fourth-smallest by total area. The west boundary is largely in Lake Winnebago. The Niagara Escarpment runs north-south several miles east of the western boundary. The topography has been greatly influenced by glaciation.
