Gogebic County (/ɡoʊˈɡɪ.bɪk/ go-GI-bik) is the westernmost county in the Upper Peninsula in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2010 census, the population was 16,427. The county seat is Bessemer. This was historically part of the territory of the Lake Superior Band of Chippewa, which had twelve bands in Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. The Lac Vieux Desert Indian Reservation is in this county, in Watersmeet Township, as the land base of one of the federally recognized tribes.
The county was set off and organized in 1887. It had been part of Ontonagon County. The name is said to be derived from the Ojibwe word bic, which most references interpret as "rock." Alternatively, it is claimed to be derived from Lake Agogebic, later changed to Lake Gogebic, which was also derived from an Ojibwe word. See List of Michigan county name etymologies.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 1,476 square miles (3,820 km2), of which 1,102 square miles (2,850 km2) is land and 374 square miles (970 km2) (25%) is water.
