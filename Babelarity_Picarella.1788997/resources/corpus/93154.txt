Claravis is a genus that contains three species of doves that live in the Neotropics, with ranges in Middle America and South America. Claravis doves have red eyes and pink legs, and the plumages of the males are primarily light grey-blue, and the females are primarily brown. Both sexes have a series of distinctive spots or bands on the wings. They are fairly arboreal for ground doves. Claravis doves have a distinct fast and rocking flight pattern. They are found alone, in pairs or in small flocks in forests. The blue ground dove remains widespread and fairly common, but the purple-winged and maroon-chested ground doves are generally local and rare, and appears to be associated with flowering bamboo.
