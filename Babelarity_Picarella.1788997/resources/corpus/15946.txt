Ben Ainslie took his fifth consecutive sailing medal, and his fourth consecutive gold. However there was a heavy battle with Jonas Høgh Christensen of Denmark that was only decided at the last mark of the medal race. Ainslie and Høgh Christensen finally had an equal amount of point but Ainslie had a higher score in one of the races.
Dutchman Pieter-Jan Postma almost took the gold while Ainslie and Høgh Christensen were battling it out, but at the last buoy Postma hit the camera on the New Zealand boat and took a penalty lap, dropping him to 4th place.
Ainslie took over the position of Paul Elvstrøm as most successful Olympic sailor with one silver medal in 1996 (Laser) and fourth consecutive gold 2000 (Laser), 2004 (Finn), 2008 (Finn) and 2012 (Finn). Elvstrøm won the Firefly in 1948 and the Finn in 1952, 1956 and 1960.
