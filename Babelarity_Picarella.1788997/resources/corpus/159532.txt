Castel San Giovanni (Piacentine dialect: Castél San Giuàn) is a town and comune in the province of Piacenza, Emilia-Romagna, Italy.
The origins of the town are probably related to an ancient pieve called Olubra and a fortress called Castellus Milonus, which preceded the construction of a new castle by Alberto Scoto in 1290 (now also disappeared).
After a period under the Dal Verme family of lords-condottieri, it became part of the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza in 1485.
