Meñli I Giray (Crimean Tatar: I Meñli Geray, ۱منكلى كراى‎) (1445–1515), also spelled as Mengli I Giray, was a khan of the Crimean Khanate (1466, 1469–1475, 1478–1515) and the sixth son of Hacı I Giray.
Meñli ascended the throne in 1466 for some months, but was then deposed by his brother Nur Devlet. He was restored to the throne in January 1469, but lost power again in March 1475 as a result of a rebellion of the rival brothers and nobility.
In 1475, he was captured by the Ottomans in Feodosiya and delivered to Constantinople. After being forced to recognize Ottoman suzerainty over the Crimean Khanate, he was returned to the throne of Crimea in 1478. He made a great contribution to the development of Crimean Tatar statehood. He founded the fortress of Özü.
In 1502, Meñli defeated the last khan of the Golden Horde and took control over its capital Saray. He proclaimed himself Khagan (Emperor), claiming legitimacy as the successor of the Golden Horde's authority over the Tatar khaganates in the Caspian-Volga region.
Meñli was buried in the Dürbe (or türbe) of Salaçıq in Bakhchysarai. In that city, he commissioned Zıncırlı Medrese (medrese with chains) in Salaçıq (1500), Dürbe in Salaçıq (1501), and "Demir Qapı" (Iron Gate) portal in the Bakhchisaray Palace (by Aloisio the New) (1503).
Meñli was a father of Mehmed I Giray and Sahib I Giray.
Meñli I Giray was the maternal grandfather of Suleiman the Magnificent through his daughter Ayşe Hafsa Sultan; thereafter, the House of Osman could also claim descent from Genghis Khan through his son Jochi.
Meñli's wives were:
Zayan (Shayan) Sultan Khatun, daughter of Prince Yadigar, bey of the Sedjeuts;
Makhdum Sultan Khatun, daughter of King Inarmaz Mirza, King of Circassia;
Nur Sultan Khatun, daughter of Prince Timur ibn Mansur, bey of the Manghits.
