Christopher William Mercer (born 26 January 1985) is a British electronic dubstep producer and DJ.
Rusko graduated from Leeds College of Music with a degree in Music Performance. Immersed in the world of dubstep through Leeds based event "Sub Dub" which was held at the West Indian Centre, Rusko moved to London to work with the record label Sub Soldiers with now no longer associated act Caspa. During this period he introduced producer Reso to Dubstep and the two lived for a time together, driving his roommate "a bit mental" with hearing the track "Cockney Thug" through the wall for a week.
On 26 October 2012, Fact Magazine posted an interview with Rusko where he stated he planned to release his music for free instead of signing with Mad Decent again, following his dispute with the record label about the release of his second album. The Kapow EP is his first self release. In 2013 he joined OWSLA.
In 2015, Rusko and his former production/DJ partner Caspa announced a reunion with their first American show together.
