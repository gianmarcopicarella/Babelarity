Boiro is a municipality in the province of A Coruña in the autonomous community of Galicia in northwestern Spain. It is located in the comarca of Barbanza. Boiro has an area of 86.58 km2.
It is perhaps best known as the small town where famous quadriplegic (and Galician) Ramón Sampedro received euthanasia. The town was thus filmed in for the 2004 film Mar Adentro, which won an Oscar.
Boiro is also well known for local tourists that come from inner Spain to enjoy the milder climate and landscape, most notably the Barbanza mountain chain, Praia de Barraña (which lies close to the town center), and Carragueiros and Mañóns beaches (one in O Castro parish and the other in Abanqueiro parish).
