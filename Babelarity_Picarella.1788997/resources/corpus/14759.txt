The 2013 Korean Grand Prix (formally known as the 2013 Formula 1 Korean Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race that was held on 6 October 2013 at the Korea International Circuit in Yeongnam, South Korea. The race was the fourteenth round of the 2013 season, and marked the fourth running of the Korean Grand Prix.
The race which was contested over 55 laps was won by Sebastian Vettel, driving for Red Bull Racing. He dominantly won the race to claim his fourth consecutive victory of the year.
The result meant that Vettel extended his lead to 77 points over Alonso and could seal his fourth consecutive championship in the next race in Japan if results went his way. Räikkönen leapfrogged Hamilton to go third, 28 points behind Alonso while Hamilton's result meant he was six points behind Räikkönen's score. Behind them, Mark Webber, who retired after a fire due to a collision with Adrian Sutil, kept fifth while Rosberg also stayed in sixth.
Despite major circuit renovations including a complete modification to the exit of the pit lane, this was the last Korean Grand Prix in Formula One to date.
