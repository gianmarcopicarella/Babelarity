The Plymouth Rock is a breed of domestic chicken from the United States. It originated in New England in the 19th century from cross-breeding of Dominiques and Black Javas.
The Plymouth Rock was bred as a dual-purpose fowl, meaning that it was valued both for meat and eggs. Plymouth Rock chickens are cold-hardy. The hens lay brown eggs, and continue laying all through the winter with decreased production.
The Plymouth Rock was developed in New England in the early 1800s by crossing Dominiques and Black Javas.. John C. Bennett (1804â€“1867) has been credited with either creating or popularizing the breed.
In the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, seven color varieties of the Plymouth Rock are recognized: Barred, Blue, Buff, Columbian, Partridge, Silver-penciled and White. In Australia, the Barred variant is split into two separate colors, Dark Barred and Light Barred. The difference between these colors is highly noticeable, with the bars of white color wider and the grey lighter in the Light Barred than in Dark Barred.
