Selbyville traces its history back to its founding in 1778. It was incorporated in 1902.
Selbyville was originally known as Sandy Branch due to its location on a branch of that name emanating in the Cypress Swamp at the head of the St. Martin's River. A grist mill and saw mill opened there in the late 18th century. In 1842, Sampson Selby began marking packages for delivery to his country store, Selby-Ville.
By 1918, Selbyville was the major supplier of strawberries for the entire east coast, an industry that remained strong until the 1930s.
Today, one of its main employers is Mountaire Farms, a poultry company, which runs a processing plant on Hosier Street.
This town is also home of the Mumford Sheet Metal Works, which once held the world record for the largest frying pan in 1950.
Selbyville is also home to Doyle's Restaurant, which has recently been recognized by the State of Delaware as the oldest operating diner in the State, and still has the original 1930's diner attached to the main restaurant that is still available for diners to eat at.
