Lee Young-ae (born January 31, 1971) is a South Korean actress. She has appeared in the Korean historical drama Dae Jang Geum, and as a revenge seeking single mother in Park Chan-wook's crime thriller film Sympathy for Lady Vengeance.
Lee made her debut as a TV model in 1991. After appearing in T.V. commercials, she started playing in T.V. dramas and movies.
She came to prominence in South Korea after starring in the drama Dae Jang Geum. The show was then aired overseas and became exceptionally popular in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Sri Lanka and Cambodia. In 2005, nearly half the population of Hong Kong watched the finale of the drama. In mainland China, hundreds of million of viewers watched the drama despite the fact that it was shown late at night.
She was awarded Best Actress in the 2005 Blue Dragon Film Awards and 2006 Baeksang Art Awards for her performance in the film Sympathy For Lady Vengeance.
Because of her success, Lee Young-Ae has been invited to visit mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Japan. In 2006, for the first time in 12 years, NHK had to use NHK Hall to host the NHK show due to her popularity. She was invited to the 2007 Harbin International Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival in China.
In her 2006 autobiography “Young-Ae’s Vow”, she recalled how she became an actress. She first entered show business after working with Andy Lau in a 1991 chocolate advertisement. In 1995, she made the decision to go to graduate school in order to learn theory of acting. Since then, she has challenged herself in various kinds of acting roles, like that in Dae Jang Geum and later a very different role in Sympathy For Lady Vengeance.
In 2007, she received the Medal of Culture Merit for her contribution to Korean Wave from the South Korean government.
Her major contract in 2006 and 2007 was with LG Corp., a large South Korean conglomerate. She became the Pan-Asian spokesmodel for all LG Electronics' products.
Besides her acting career, she has also been involved with several charities. In 1997 she went to Ethiopia as a NGO Goodwill Ambassador. She went to Thar Desert in 1999 to do a TV show about people in India's lowest social caste. Later in 2001, she published these experiences in her autobiography “A Most Special Love” and donated the income from the sale of the book to charity.
She was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador in 2004 by UNICEF and has since held several charity functions. She has made many donations to schools and hospitals, including the Chosun First Middle School in Harbin and an elementary school in China that was thereafter renamed Lee Young-Ae Elementary School.
In July 2014, Taiwanese media reported that Lee had privately assisted a pregnant Taiwanese woman who was vacationing with her husband in Seoul. The woman gave birth to her daughter prematurely and the infant had several complications. Lee found out about the couple through her friend and decided to pay their medical bills, which amounted to around NT$4 million (US$134,000) because the infant required two surgeries and constant medical care after she was born.
Her popularity in Sri Lanka ultimately led to the creation of the "Sujatha Diyani Scholarship Fund" in 2014 where she donated US$100 000. The fund aims at providing financial assistance to female students of low income families.
On August 24, 2009, Lee married Jeong Ho-young, a Korean-American businessman 20 years her senior, in the United States. On February 20, 2011, Lee gave birth to twins, one boy and one girl, at the Jeil Hospital in Jung-gu, Seoul.
