Volc√°n Tupungatito is the northernmost historically active stratovolcano of the southern Andes. It lies on the border between Argentina and Chile, about 99 km (62 mi) east of Santiago, Chile, and immediately southwest of the massive Cerro Tupungato stratovolcano. Its name is a diminutive homonym, and means Little Tupungato.
