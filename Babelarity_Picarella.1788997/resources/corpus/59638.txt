Cadmium sulfate is the name of a series of related inorganic compounds with the formula CdSO4·xH2O. The most common form is the monohydrate CdSO4·H2O, but two other forms are known CdSO4·8/3H2O and the anhydrous salt (CdSO4). All salts are colourless and highly soluble in water.
Cadmium sulfate octohydrate can be prepared by the reaction of cadmium metal or its oxide or hydroxide with dilute sulfuric acid:
CdO + H2SO4 → CdSO4 + H2O
Cd + H2SO4 → CdSO4 + H2
The anhydrous material is prepared using sodium persulfate:
Cd + Na2S2O8 → CdSO4 + Na2SO4
Cadmium sulfate is very rarely found naturally as the tetrahydrate mineral drobecite (CdSO4·4H2O) and as a basic salt in the mineral niedermayrite (Cu4Cd(SO4)2(OH)6·4H2O).
Cadmium sulfate is used widely for the electroplating of cadmium in electronic circuits. It is also a precursor to cadmium-based pigment such as cadmium sulfide. It is also used for electrolyte in a Weston standard cell as well as a pigment in fluorescent screens.
