At the 1978 European Championships, 15-year-old Denise Biellmann became the first female skater to land the triple lutz in competition. She underrotated it, with two-foot landing. At the same event, she became the first woman to receive a 6.0 in technical merit, receiving the score from British judge Pauline Borrajo. She was 12th in figures, first in the free skate, and finished fourth overall. Another triple lutz was performed only by Jan Hoffmann.
