Piotr Giza (born February 28, 1980 in Kraków) is a Polish football player. He is a hard working central midfielder or attacking midfielder.
Giza moved to Cracovia during the 2002/03 season and made his Polish League debut on July 30, 2004 against Zagłębie Lubin. After a falling out with his manager Stefan Majewski at Cracovia he stopped being included in the squad, even though he was generally considered one of the best offensive midfielders of the league.
In 2007 after 5 years in Cracovia, he decided to play for Legia Warsaw on a loan deal. Though sometimes criticized for his poor performances and low goal count Legia decided to make the deal permanent for the 2008/09 season.
He returned to Cracovia on 13 December 2010. He was released half year later.
Giza has been capped five times for Poland.
