Mario Pizziolo (7 December 1909 – 30 April 1990) was an Italian football (soccer) player who played as a midfielder.
He was born in Castellammare Adriatico, province of Pescara.
Pizziolo started his career in the youth teams of Livorno and Ternana and Pistoiese (1925–1929), before joining the senior team of Fiorentina, where he played between 1929 and 1936, playing 197 matches and scoring three goals.
He played twelve matches for Italy between 1933 and 1934, scoring one goal. He was a part of the 1934 World Cup winning side, in which he played one game, the first against Spain, in which he was roughly hit (he had one of his legs broken). So, Pizziolo could not play the other games and the final match for Italy, and was not awarded a medal for his performance until 1988, two years before he died, in Florence, at the age of eighty.
