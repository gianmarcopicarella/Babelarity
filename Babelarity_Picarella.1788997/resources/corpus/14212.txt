Ike Ibrahim Shorunmu (born October 16, 1967) is a former football goalkeeper from Nigeria.
Shorunmu was born in Lagos. After a few years in Nigeria he moved to play in Switzerland, and made his mark there. He was bought by Turkish club Beşiktaş J.K. in 1999 for $2,400,000 — but they released him as they thought he spent too much time with the national team. Shorunmu later played for other Swiss and Turkish clubs.
He has been the first-choice goalkeeper of the national team, and played at the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Shorunmu was brought into the Nigerian national team by coach Clemens Westerhof in 1992.
Shorunmu has recently served as the national team goalkeeper coach as well as for Enyimba F.C.. In 2010 Shorunmu was hired in the same capacity for Heartland F.C.
