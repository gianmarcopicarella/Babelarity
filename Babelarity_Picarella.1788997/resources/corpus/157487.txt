Tūpai, also called Motu Iti, is a low-lying atoll in Society Islands, French Polynesia. It lies 19 km to the north of Bora Bora and belongs to the western Leeward Islands (Iles sous le Vent). This small atoll is only 11 km² in area. Its broad coral reef encloses a shallow sandy lagoon. There are almost continuous long wooded motus on Tūpai's reef. Tupai has no permanent residents apart from some workers in the coconut plantations. There is a private airfield on Tūpai. It was inaugurated in 2001 and its use is restricted.
Tūpai Atoll belongs administratively to the commune of Bora Bora.
In 1926 the island was considered for settling a small community of Slovak colonists but was later dropped in favor of the Marquesas Islands
