Mucc (Japanese: ムック, Hepburn: Mukku, officially romanized as MUCC) is a Japanese visual kei rock band, formed in Ibaraki in 1997. Named after a character from the children's TV show Hirake! Ponkikki, the band is also known by the nickname 69 since "six nine" can be pronounced "muku" in Japanese. As of 2015, the band has released twelve studio albums, two live albums, three EPs, thirty-three singles and seventeen home videos, some of which were also released in Europe.
Formed in 1997 by Miya, Tatsurou (then called "Tattoo"), Satochi and Hiro, they originally played The Blue Hearts and Glay covers. In 1999 Hiro left and was replaced by Miya's childhood friend Yukke. In December Mucc made their first official release, the EP Antique. They released their first album, Tsūzetsu in January 2001. In 2002 they signed to Danger Crue, but to their own sublabel Shu, and released their second album Hōmura Uta.
Mucc debuted in Europe in August 2005, including a performance at Wacken Open Air. The following year, they performed in the United States at the Otakon anime convention. They returned to the United States in 2007 for the JRock Revolution Festival.
They participated on the Taste of Chaos 2008 tour, which stopped at forty cities across the United States and Canada from February to May, along with fellow Japanese bands D'espairsRay and the Underneath. After returning to Japan in May, Mucc performed at the hide memorial summit alongside other famous rock groups such as X Japan, Luna Sea, Versailles and heidi.. In October the Taste of Chaos tour went to Europe, in the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Finland and the United Kingdom. Mucc performed at The Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza on December 7, 2008 and the House of Blues in Los Angeles on December 10.
In 2009, they once again went to Europe for their "Solid Sphere Tour" starting with a live in Russia on October 3, and for the first time performed two shows in Latin America (Chile and Mexico). The band completed the tour on November 16 in Japan at the JCB Hall, with a total of 18 songs. Mucc started 2010 with a concert on February 14 at the NHK Hall, where they announced they would release a new album that fall. Karma was released on October 6 and has a post-disco or dance sound mixed with Mucc's usual hard rock and metal.
On May 21, 2011, at their "Mucc History Gigs 97～11" Nippon Budokan show, Mucc announced they would be switching labels to Sony Music Associated Records. Their single "Akatsuki" was first sold exclusively at that concert and the following day's, later being available as a digital download with all proceeds donated to aid the victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. Mucc's next single, "Nirvana", was released on March 7, 2012 and used as the opening theme song for the Inu x Boku SS anime. It is their third contribution to an animated series; previously their song "Chain Ring" was used as the ending theme to the Zombie-Loan adaptation and their single "Yakusoku" was used as the opening theme to Night Raid 1931.
An album titled Aishū no Antique, composed of remastered songs mainly from their two EPs Antique and Aishū, was released at their 15th anniversary live, Mucc vs ムック vs Mucc, at Makuhari Messe on June 9, 2012. At the concert they announced a consecutive 3 month DVD release documenting the entire 15th anniversary live. They also announced the release of their eleventh studio album Shangri-La for November 30, 2012. The third single for the album, "Mother", was released on October 31 and was one of the ending themes for Naruto Shippuden, their fourth anime tie in. The album's song "Kyōran Kyoshō -21st Century Baby-" was the theme song for the horror movie Fuan no Tane.
In 2013, Mucc began looking for two new members who would participate in recording, photo shoots and interviews. Applicants had to send in five stickers included with CDs, DVDs and other goods, released in commemoration of the band's 15th anniversary along with an application; it was noted that they did not need to know how to play an instrument. The winners were selected by Mucc's four primary members themselves and given stage names, after interviews and reviewing resumes on a live broadcast on Niconico on July 26. Hancho, a Hungarian female study abroad student from the band's native Ibaraki, and Dean, a male office worker from Chiba Prefecture officially joined the band on August 17. However, on September 4, roughly two weeks later, it was announced that both had left the group. Dean left after his parents found out he had joined a rock band by seeing him on TV, and Hancho stated she had achieved her dream of joining Mucc and could now leave to become a fan once more.
On December 1, 2013, Mucc gave a free performance in Amerikamura's Triangle Park to an estimated 3,000 fans.
