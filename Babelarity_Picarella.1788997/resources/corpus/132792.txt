Ansegisel (also Ansgise, Ansegus, or Anchises) (c. 602 or 610 – murdered before 679 or 662) was the son of Saint Arnulf, bishop of Metz, and his wife Doda. He served King Sigbert III of Austrasia (634–656) as a duke (Latin dux, a military leader) and domesticus. He was killed sometime before 679, slain in a feud by his enemy Gundewin. Through his son Pepin, Ansegisel's descendants would eventually become Frankish kings and rule over the Carolingian Empire.
He was married to Begga, the daughter of Pepin the Elder, sometime after 639. They had the following children:
Pepin II (635 or 640 – December 16, 714), who would later become Mayor of the Palace of Austrasia
Martin of Herstal
Clotilda of Herstal (650–699), married King Theuderic III of Neustria
