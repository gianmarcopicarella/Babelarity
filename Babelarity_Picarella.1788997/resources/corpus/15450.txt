Club Deportivo San José is a football club from Oruro, Bolivia. Founded on the 19 March 1942, they won the 1st division in 1955 (Semiprofessional Era – Torneo Integrado), 1995 and Clausura 2007. Their colours are white and blue, and they play at the Estadio Jesús Bermúdez (capacity 35,000).
It is widely believed that Bolivian President Evo Morales trained with this team, but never got to play league football, but in reality he only trained (and played) for San José La Joya, a feeder team of San José.
