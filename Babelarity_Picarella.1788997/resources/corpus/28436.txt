Courcelette is a commune in the Somme department in Picardie in northern France.
Courcelette is situated on the D929 and D107 crossroads, some 30 miles (48 km) northeast of Amiens.
Courcelette was a major tactical objective in the Battle of Flers-Courcelette during the Somme Offensive of the First World War during which the village was razed. The village was assigned as the major objective of the Canadian Corps during that battle and they succeeded in capturing it. Accordingly, the actions and sacrifices of the Canadians are commemorated at the Courcelette Memorial which is just south of the village beside the D929 roadway.
