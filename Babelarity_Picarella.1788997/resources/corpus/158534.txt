Shangluo (Chinese: 商洛; pinyin: Shāngluò) is a prefecture-level city in southeastern Shaanxi province, People's Republic of China, bordering Henan to the northeast and Hubei to the southeast. Part of the Shannan region of the province, it is located in the eastern part of the Qin Mountains (Qin Ling). The name, Shangluo, comes from Han Dynasty when four famous people were settled in Shang Mountain to avoid war and famine.
As with the other two anchoring cities of Shannan, Shangluo has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cwa), with cool winters, hot, humid summers, and ample precipitation by provincial standards. It experiences temperatures more moderate than Xi'an and the rest of the Wei River valley to the immediate north, especially so during summer due to the high elevation. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from 0.5 °C (32.9 °F) in January to 24.4 °C (75.9 °F) in July, while the annual mean is 12.79 °C (55.0 °F). About 60% of the approximately 670 millimetres (26.4 in) of annual precipitation occurs from June to September. The frost-free period lasts 200 days, and there are about 2,000 hours of bright sunshine annually.
