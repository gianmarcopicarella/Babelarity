Ludbreg is a town in Croatia, located halfway between Varaždin and Koprivnica near the river Drava. It has 3,603 inhabitants, and a total of 8,478 in the entire municipality (census 2011).
For centuries Ludbreg has been a popular place of pilgrimage. In 1320 the city was mentioned for the first time as Castrum Ludbreg. The name of the town comes probably from a crusader named Lobring, who founded the settlement. The renovated Castle of Batthyány is home to a well-known restoration workshop. Ludbreg is also a region of vineyard cultivation (especially Riesling and Graševina).
The town became famous after the eucharistic miracle, that happened in the castle chapel in 1411 and was investigated and confirmed by pope Leo X in 1513.
In the late 19th and early 20th century, Ludbreg was a district capital in the Varaždin County of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia.
