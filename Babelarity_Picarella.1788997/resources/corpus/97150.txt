Rocksteady Studios is a British video game developer based in Kentish Town, London. They have developed four games and are best known for their work in the Batman: Arkham series.
Rocksteady was founded on December 13, 2004 by Sefton Hill and Jamie Walker. The team hired many employees from the now defunct Argonaut Games. The studio released Urban Chaos in 2006 then thanks to the huge success of Arkham Asylum in 2009, the studio was acquired by Time Warner in February 2010, although Square Enix Europe formerly Eidos Interactive still holds stock at (25.1%).
Rocksteady Studios has since became renowned for its critically acclaimed Batman games Batman: Arkham Asylum, Batman: Arkham City, and Batman: Arkham Knight. Although a prequel Arkham game was developed (Batman: Arkham Origins), Rocksteady did not act as developer for the game; instead, development was handled by WB Games Montr√©al.
