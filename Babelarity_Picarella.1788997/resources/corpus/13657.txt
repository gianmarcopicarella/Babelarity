William David "Will" Keane (born 11 January 1993) is an English professional footballer who plays as a forward for Premier League club Manchester United. Keane has been with Manchester United since the age of 11, having spent one month on loan with Wigan Athletic in December 2013, as well as the second half of that season with Queens Park Rangers. His twin brother, Michael, is a defender who currently plays for Burnley. Keane has also represented England at youth level.
Born in Stockport, Greater Manchester, Keane and his twin brother Michael grew up in the suburb of Heaton Mersey and attended St Bede's College in south Manchester. They were spotted playing football for South Manchester by Manchester United at the age of 11, and soon joined the club's academy coaching system.
Keane worked his way up through the Manchester United academy, and made his first appearance for the under-18s on 21 April 2007 against Sheffield United, a game in which both sides had agreed to field their under-16 teams; at the age of 14, Keane came on as a substitute for goalscorer Tomos Roberts in the 77th minute of a 4–0 away win. His next appearance for the under-18s came almost two years later, when he started in central midfield in a 1–0 home defeat to Stoke City on 21 February 2009. Shortly before their 16th birthday earlier in the year, both Keanes were awarded three-year scholarships with Manchester United, which began in July 2009.
The following season, Keane became a regular starter for the under-18s, scoring 13 goals in 26 appearances in 2009–10, including all three goals in a 3–0 win at home to Manchester City; he also made several substitute appearances for the reserves. His reserve debut came as a substitute in a 1–0 league win away to Everton on 6 October 2009, and he scored his first goal five months later, in Manchester United's penultimate group match in the Manchester Senior Cup against Stockport County on 8 March 2010; after coming on for Nicky Ajose on the hour mark, Keane scored 14 minutes later to give Manchester United a 1–0 win.
At the end of the season, Keane made a substitute appearance for the reserves in the Premier Reserve League Play-off Final against Aston Villa. After the game finished 1–1, the teams went to penalties, where Keane missed United's third penalty in a 3–2 shoot-out victory to win the Premier Reserve League title. Keane's performances during the 2009–10 season saw him receive the Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year award.
Despite making just 17 appearances for the under-18s in 2010–11, Keane finished as the team's top scorer with 16 goals, including eight in just six FA Youth Cup matches – three in the semi-final second leg against Chelsea and three more over the two legs of the final against Sheffield United. He also scored six goals in 10 appearances for the reserves; only a missed penalty denied him a hat-trick in a 5–1 win over Newcastle United on 16 December 2010, Ole Gunnar Solskjær's final match as manager.
Keane was ever-present for the reserves in the league in 2011–12, scoring 14 times in 22 appearances, as well as four more in seven cup appearances. His best performance of the season came on 16 April 2012, when he scored four in a 6–3 win away to Newcastle United to confirm Manchester United as winners of the Premier Reserve League North. They again faced Aston Villa in the championship play-off, and again the match went to penalties, but this time Keane scored from his kick as United won 3–1. Keane was on the scoresheet again a week later as United made it a double with a 2–0 victory over Manchester City in the final of the Manchester Senior Cup.
After being named as an unused substitute for a 2–1 defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League on 5 February 2011 and a 3–0 win over Aldershot Town in the fourth round of the 2011–12 Football League Cup on 25 October 2011, Keane made his senior debut on 31 December 2011 in a 3–2 defeat at home to Blackburn Rovers in the Premier League, coming on as a late substitute for Rafael.
A knee ligament injury suffered while on international duty with the England under-19s in May 2012 kept Keane out for the entire 2012–13 season. He made his return for the under-21s at home to Bolton Wanderers on 16 September 2013, scoring the first goal in a 4–1 win. Three more goals followed in the under-21s' next two matches, against Bury and Bolton in the Manchester Senior Cup. On 28 November 2013, Keane joined fellow Manchester United youngster Nick Powell on a one-month loan at Wigan Athletic. He made his debut at home to Derby County the following weekend, only to be replaced by Grant Holt at half-time with Wigan 3–0 down; they went on to lose the game 3–1. After failing to find the net in four appearances for Wigan, Keane returned to Manchester United in December 2013 having suffered a groin injury.
After recovering from injury, Keane made a loan move to Queens Park Rangers on 31 January 2014 until the end of the 2013–14 season.
On 22 January 2015 Keane joined Sheffield Wednesday on loan for the remainder of the season. He made his Wednesday debut on 27 January in a 0-0 draw at Hillsborough against Birmingham City. His first senior goal came from the penalty spot to draw level in the Owls' 1-1 home draw to Cardiff Cty on 7 February.
On 8 July 2015, Keane signed on a season-long loan deal with Preston North End. On 31 December 2015, Manchester United recalled Keane from his loan.
Despite being eligible for the Republic of Ireland through his father, Keane made his debut for the England under-16 team in a 3–1 win against Russia in 2009. He scored one goal in three appearances for the side. He was part of the England under-17 team that won the 2010 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship, appearing in the final. He made a total of 15 appearances and scored three goals for the team. He then progressed to the under-19 side where he made six appearances and scored one goal. He received a call up to the under-21 side managed by Stuart Pearce in November 2011, and received praise from Manchester United reserve team manager Warren Joyce, with Joyce saying Keane deserved the call up after his good form for the reserve team. He made his first appearance during a 5–0 win against Iceland, coming off the bench to replace midfielder Josh McEachran in the 78th minute. He appeared in the following game four days later against Belgium, this time coming on as a substitute for Marvin Sordell. On 25 May 2012, he scored twice as England under-19s beat Slovenia 5–0 at Deepdale. Keane suffered a knee ligament injury on 30 May 2012 while playing for England Under-19s against Switzerland which resulted in him missing the whole of the 2012–13 season.
