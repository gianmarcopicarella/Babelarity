Oviedo is a city in Seminole County, Florida, United States. As of the 2010 United States Census, the population was 33,342, reflecting an increase of 7,026 (26.7%) from the 26,316 counted in the 2000 Census. It is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford Metropolitan Statistical Area.
In the late 1870s, individuals living a couple miles south of Lake Jesup needed an easily accessible post office in the Florida back country. Andrew Aulin, an early settler and shop-owner, decided to file paperwork for a post office; in his first site location report he needed a unique name, one that no other post office in Florida had. Aulin liked having a Spanish name, "to go with the Spanish name of the state," and decided to name his post office location Oviedo after the city of Oviedo in northern Spain (the capital city of the Principality of Asturias) and the University of Oviedo. Some say he visited the University, others say he just liked the sound, most agree he likely pronounced it "Oh-vee-Ay-Doh" rather than the Americanized way of "Oh-VEE-doh."

In 2015, the city of Oviedo dedicated a brand new downtown development just south of the current "old downtown" along Oviedo Blvd. The new town center, named "Oviedo on the Park", is a mixed use development with townhouses, apartment homes, restaurants, and retail. It is centered around the new Center Lake Park with a man-made lake, large amphitheater, playground and Veterans Tribute.
A new Emergency Room (ER) hospital, called Oviedo ER, was completed in 2014. Oviedo ER is a department of Central Florida Regional Hospital. The Oviedo ER is located on the corner of Red Bug Lake Road and West Broadway.

Part of Oviedo's southern charm is the population of chickens that roam the downtown area. There are so many of them roaming the area that traffic often stops as they cross the roads. The chickens have been featured on Oviedo T-shirts and coffee mugs and a poster commemorating one of Oviedo's yearly festivals, "A Taste of Oviedo."
Contrary to what some believe, there are no specific laws or statutes surrounding the chickens, neither for their protection nor for their removal - the latter being something some residents would like to see due to the danger they pose with traffic in the congested town center. For others, however, the chickens add an element of fun.
There are City Ordinances that protect birds in the City Limits, the entire city is designated a bird sanctuary. Chickens are afforded the courtesy of protection under the code.
The chickens were also the subject of a short documentary that was part of the Florida Film Festival 2009. 
In August 2004, the northwestern side of Hurricane Charley passed directly over Oviedo while still a Category 2 storm. More than half the city as well as much of the surrounding unincorporated areas had no power for 5 to 7 days. School was not in session county-wide for one full school week. The damages ranged from toppled oaks to destroyed homes. The worst damage was in Palm Valley, a mobile home retirement community less than a mile from UCF. Charley's damage in Oviedo is considered to be the worst in Seminole County history. Barely a month later, Hurricanes Frances and Jeanne further battered the area resulting in additional damage and power outages, but they did not reach the level of Charley's fury.
Tropical Storm Fay hung over Oviedo for days during 2008 with high winds, heavy rains, and flooded roads.
