Ferenc Puskás Stadium (Hungarian: Puskás Ferenc Stadion) is a multi-purpose stadium in Budapest, Hungary that is currently undergoing reconstruction. It is situated on the Pest side of the capital between the Puskás Ferenc Stadion and the Keleti pályaudvar metro stations. It is used mainly for football matches. The stadium, which is all-seater, had a capacity of 38,652, though its original capacity exceeded 100,000.
The first plan of a national stadium were drafted as early as 1896 when there were chances that Budapest would host the first modern Olympic Games.
In 1911 Budapest received the right to organise the 1920 Olympics but due to the First World War Budapest could not hold the Olympic Games.
The location of the first plan included Budapest XI. district and Budapest X. district.
In 1924 the government imposed a sport tax which was supposed to be use for the construction of a new national stadium, but finally this money was not used for the construction.
The stadium was built between 1948 and 1953 using a large number of volunteers, including soldiers. Less than one year later, on 23 May 1954, the English football team suffered its worst ever defeat here (7–1).
On 14 August 2002 Zalaegerszegi TE moved their UEFA Champions League qualifying match first leg from their home ground to this stadium in order to host Manchester United in order to accommodate a 40,000 crowd. They were rewarded with Zalaegerszeg scoring their most famous European victory, winning 1–0 with Béla Koplárovics becoming the hero with a 92nd-minute winner. Zalaegerszegi lost the return leg at Old Trafford 0–5 and went out of the competition 1–5 on aggregate.
The stadium is named after Ferenc Puskás, widely regarded as the best striker in the world in his time and Hungary's greatest footballer ever, who was the star of the national team during its glory years of the late 1940s and early 1950s. In 2002 the stadium was renamed in his honour, from Népstadion ("People's Stadium").

In 1988, the stadium hosted the only stop in a communist country of the Human Rights Now! tour, with the artists Hobo Blues Band, Tracy Chapman, Youssou N'Dour, Peter Gabriel, Sting and Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band.

Despite several attempts, the Hungarian government and football federation couldn't succeed in redeveloping the stadium. The first attempt was abandoned when the Hungarian bid for Euro 2012 wasn't selected by UEFA. Then came various propositions for a 40–65,000 seat stadium that also couldn't get through. However, the overall policy remains to redevelop it completely.
The stadium was rumoured to be demolished sometime in 2012 and replaced with the New Puskás Ferenc Stadium. As of October 2012 no demolition work has begun. Instead, in October the Hungarian government announced plans to develop a final design in 2013 and start construction in 2014. If so, the new 68,000-seat stadium would be ready in 2016. Additionally, numerous other sports venues are planned around it to create a multi-discipline national complex by 2020. The scheme would be financed with a 30-year loan.
