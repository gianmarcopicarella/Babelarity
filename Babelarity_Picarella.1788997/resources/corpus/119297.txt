1864 Daedalus, provisional designation 1971 FA, is a stony asteroid classified as a near-Earth object, that measures about 3 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Dutch–American astronomer Tom Gehrels at Palomar Observatory, California, on 24 March 1971.
It is a member of the Apollo asteroids, a group of near-Earth object with an Earth-crossing orbit. Daedalus orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.6–2.4 AU once every 1.77 years (645 days) and has a SQ/Sr spectral type with an albedo of 0.2 or more. Its rotation period has been measured to take 8.572 hours. It has an Earth Minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID) of 0.2688 AU.
It is named after the Greek mythological figure Daedalus, the builder of King Minos' labyrinth, who was subsequently imprisoned there with his son Icarus. They escaped on wings of feathers and wax, but whereas Icarus was drowned when the wax in his wings melted, Daedalus went on to Sicily and built there a temple to Apollo. There is also a lunar crater called Daedalus.
