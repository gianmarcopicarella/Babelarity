Cezarina began in 1960, with the construction of the BR-060 highway. At that time the rancher, João Argemiro Cezar decided to donate his lands, where the center of the town is now located. He hired Agil José da Rocha to measure the lands, granting him a free lot. Agil José built a gasoline station on the edge of the highway, which became the first building in Cezarina. Little by little the town began to grow. The name "Cezarina" was chosen because of its founder, João Cezar. In 1988 it became a city.
