Antolín Alcaraz Viveros (born 30 July 1982) is a Paraguayan professional footballer who plays for Club Libertad as a central defender.
He rarely settled with a team in his early career, before signing in 2003 with Beira-Mar and remaining with the club five seasons, after which he joined Club Brugge. He spent most of the remainder of his career in the Premier League, mainly with Wigan Athletic.
Alcaraz represented Paraguay at the 2010 World Cup and the 2011 Copa América, helping them to the final of the latter tournament.
Hailing from a humble background, Alcaraz worked throughout his teenage years as a builder’s assistant in his hometown of San Roque González de Santa Cruz in the Paraguarí Department. After starting at amateur football in his country, the 19-year-old moved to Argentina and signed with Racing Club de Avellaneda, appearing rarely during his spell. In 2002 he was loaned to ACF Fiorentina, but the Italians soon faced bankruptcy and regrouped in the Lega Pro Seconda Divisione; he then had a trial at U.S. Città di Palermo, but nothing came of it.
In January 2003, Alcaraz signed for Portuguese club S.C. Beira-Mar. After seven appearances in half a season he became a defensive mainstay at the Aveiro team, eventually also gaining club captaincy; in 2005–06 he helped them return to the Primeira Liga, playing 31 matches.
On 30 April 2007, Alcaraz was signed by Club Brugge KV in Belgium, with the deal being effective as of July.
After a slow first season he also eventually became first-choice, helping his team to two third-places and one second.
On 14 May 2010, Alcaraz signed with Wigan Athletic for an undisclosed fee, as his contract with Brugge was due to expire at the end of June. He scored his first goal for the club against Sunderland on 11 September 2010, netting in the 86th minute for an eventual 1–1 home draw.
On 6 November 2011, Alcaraz caused widespread controversy when replays showed him spitting at Wolverhampton Wanderers defender Richard Stearman during Wigan's 1–3 defeat at Molineux Stadium, and served a three-game suspension due to his actions. He later issued an apology.
On 7 May 2012, Alcaraz scored the game's only goal at Blackburn Rovers to retain the Latics' top division safety, whilst relegating their opponent to the Football League Championship. He won the 2013 FA Cup, featuring the full 90 minutes in the 1–0 upset against Manchester City. However, only three days later, with him on the pitch again, Wigan were relegated from the top division following a 1–4 defeat at Arsenal.
On 9 July 2013, after his contract at Wigan expired, Alcaraz joined Everton on a two-year deal as both he and goalkeeper Joel Robles followed their manager Roberto Martínez to the club. He made his competitive debut on 29 December after an injury struck his start to the season, featuring the full 90 minutes in a 2–1 home win over Southampton.
On 26 April 2014, Alcaraz scored an own goal in the first minute of a 0–2 loss to Southampton. On 1 January of the following year, he received his first sending off as an Everton player, being shown two yellow cards in a 0–2 defeat at Hull City which was the team's fourth successive of the festive period.
On 10 June 2015, Alcaraz was released by the Toffees.
On 2 August 2015, aged nearly 33, Alcaraz signed a one-year deal with newly promoted La Liga team UD Las Palmas with the option of a second one. He scored his first goal on 23 September, helping defeat Sevilla FC 2–0 at the Estadio Gran Canaria.
In November 2008, Alcaraz received his first call-up to the Paraguayan national team at the age of 26. He was picked for the squad present at the 2010 FIFA World Cup; on 14 June, in the group stage opener against Italy, in just his seventh cap, he headed home through a powerful header following a set piece in an eventual 1–1 draw in Cape Town, and played all the matches and minutes for the eventual quarter-finalists.
Alcaraz was again first-choice for Paraguay during the 2011 Copa América, held in Argentina. On 13 July, he scored the 1–1 equalizer against Venezuela, in an eventual 3–3 group stage draw; four days later, in the quarter-finals with Brazil, he was sent off after an altercation with Lucas Leiva, and the national side eventually finished runner-up.
