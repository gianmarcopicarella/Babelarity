Hliðskjálf is the sixth album by Norwegian band Burzum. This album was the second to be recorded by Varg Vikernes while he was imprisoned for murder and arson and also Burzum's second ambient album. Dauði Baldrs and Hliðskjálf were created with synthesized instruments as he was not allowed any other instruments while being imprisoned. The first pressing of its vinyl format release was pressed on a shiny burnished color reminiscent of gold, instead of the standard black color vinyl record.
All music composed by Varg Vikernes.
Varg Vikernes – synthesizers, glockenspiel, audio engineering, songwriting
Tania Stene – cover art
Stephen O'Malley – design/additional art
The additional art in the booklet is taken mainly from silent films. For example, the image for "Frijôs goldene Tränen" is taken from F.W. Murnau's Faust.
