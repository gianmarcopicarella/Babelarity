I Santo California are a 1970s Italian musical group.
They are a vocal and instrumental group from Campania, Southern Italy and were founded in 1975, when they recorded their biggest hit "Torneró". With this song they achieved fame in their home country and had a major hit single, which was later translated and exported worldwide.
Notwithstanding the fame and fame they achieved around the world, the group was snubbed in Italy and thus excluded from the principal musical TV programs. In 1978 they took part as contestants at the prestigious Sanremo Music Festival with the song "Monica" ending up in third place However, soon after that success their popularity decreased and the group's live performances was limited to regional and local fairs.
