Moçambola (or Campeonato Moçambicano de Futebol, Portuguese for Mozambican Football Championship) is the top division of Mozambican football, and it is organized by the Mozambican Football Federation.
In 1976, shortly after the country's independence from Portugal, the competition's first season was contested. Only five clubs took part: Académica Maputo, AD Pemba, Desportivo de Maputo, Desportivo Tete, and Textáfrica.
Until 2005, the competition was named Liga 2M. In 2005, the league was renamed to Moçambola.
The league consists of 16 clubs, with each team competing against each other team twice, round-robin style, for a total of 30 matches per season. The bottom three clubs in the league table are relegated to the second division. It currently takes place between the months of March/April and October.
