During the 1980s she appeared on over 500 magazine covers, becoming one of the most famous models of her era. She was referred to as The Face by Life Magazine. During the height of her popularity, she was the face of ad campaigns for Diet Pepsi, General Motors, Cover Girl Cosmetics, Noxzema, Hanes, and numerous others. She was the first model to produce her own posters and calendars.
