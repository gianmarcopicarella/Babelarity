The Azerbaijan Cup is a major association football competition in Azerbaijan. In its original form, it started in 1936, when Azerbaijan was a republic of the Soviet Union and it was not disputed by Azerbaijani teams in the Soviet league pyramid.
Compared to cups in many other countries, Azerbaijan attracts considerably less public interest and even the cup final is rarely sold out. Consequently, the Association of Football Federations of Azerbaijan has experimented with the format in order to raise the profile of the cup.
The clubs from Azerbaijan First Division (2nd tier) play in the First Round. The winners of that round advance to the Second Round, where the clubs from Azerbaijan Premier League (1st tier) join. For the quarterfinals and the semifinals, the round-robin system is used. For the finals, the format is restored to head-to-head.
All clubs from the Azerbaijan Premier League and First Division.
