Aberdeen /ˈæbərdiːn/ is a city in Grays Harbor County, Washington, United States. The population was 16,896 at the 2010 census. The city is the economic center of Grays Harbor County, bordering the cities of Hoquiam and Cosmopolis.
Aberdeen is called the "Gateway to the Olympic Peninsula" and is best known for being the birthplace and hometown of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain and Bryan Danielson. Some Nirvana lyrics, in songs such as "Something in the Way" and parts of the Bleach album, referred to locations within the town.
Aberdeen was named for a local salmon cannery to reflect its Scottish fishing port namesake of Aberdeen and because it too is also situated at the mouth of two rivers just like its namesake in Scotland which is located between the rivers 'Don' at the north and the river 'Dee' to the south side of the Scottish city. Aberdeen was founded by Samuel Benn in 1884 then incorporated on May 12, 1890. Although it became the largest and best-known city in Grays Harbor, Aberdeen lagged behind neighbors Hoquiam and Cosmopolis in the early years. When A.J. West built the town's first sawmill in 1894, the other two municipalities had been in business for several years. Aberdeen and its neighbors vied to be the terminus for Northern Pacific Railroad, but instead of ending at one of the established mill towns, the railroad skimmed through Cosmopolis and headed west for Ocosta. Hoquiam and Aberdeen citizens banded together to build a spur; and in 1895, the line connected Northern Pacific tracks to Aberdeen.
By 1900, Aberdeen was considered one of the grittiest towns on the West Coast, with many saloons, whorehouses, and gambling establishments populating the area. Aberdeen was nicknamed "The Hellhole of the Pacific", or "The Port of Missing Men", because of its high murder rate. One notable resident was Billy Gohl, known locally as Billy "Ghoul", who was rumored to have killed at least 140 men. (Gohl was convicted of 2 murders)
During the Great Depression, Aberdeen was hit hard, reducing the number of major sawmills from 37 to 9. Mill owners hired Filipino and Jewish immigrants to keep wages low in order to stay in business. The timber industry continued to boom, but by the late 1970s most of the timber had been logged. Most of the mills were closing down by the 1970s and 1980s.
Aberdeen is also the home port of the tall ship Lady Washington, a reproduction of a smaller vessel used by the explorer Captain Robert Gray, featured in the Pirates of the Caribbean film The Curse of the Black Pearl.
Aberdeen is located at the eastern end of Grays Harbor, near the mouth of the Chehalis River and southwest of the Olympic Mountains. Grays Harbor is notable as the northernmost ria on the Pacific Coast of North America because it has remained free of glaciers throughout the Quaternary due to unfavorable topography and warm temperatures. It is thought that, during glacial periods of the Quaternary, the Chehalis River was a major refugium for aquatic species, as was the west coast from the Olympic Peninsula southward for plants that later formed the northern part of the Pacific temperate rainforest in formerly glaciated areas.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 12.36 square miles (32.01 km2), of which 10.65 square miles (27.58 km2) is land and 1.71 square miles (4.43 km2) is water.

Occasionally, southeasterly winds can cause very high temperatures. For example, in August 1981, the temperature in Aberdeen reached 105 °F (40.6 °C).

In the book Another Roadside Attraction, by Tom Robbins, Aberdeen is mentioned as the location of the alleged body of Christ that is the central plot point to the story. A Volkswagen dealership that was near to the Hoquiam side of the border between Aberdeen and Hoquiam is also noted in the novel.
Aberdeen and Hoquiam figure prominently in Nevil Shute's post-Apocalyptic novel "On the Beach." In it, a U.S. submarine tracking a signal coming from Seattle surfaces in Grays Harbor and finds everyone in the area dead from radiation poisoning. The men on the sub talk briefly about the possibility of wearing radiation-proof suits, going into Aberdeen where they can find a car, and driving up to Seattle. Instead, they take their chances with any anti-submarine nets and hidden bombs that may be in the waters around Seattle and head northward. In the Gregory Peck/Fred Astaire movie version, Aberdeen-Hoquiam and Seattle were replaced by San Francisco.
The area and many citizens (especially then-students of Grays Harbor College) were highlighted in the 1961 movie "Ring of Fire" starring David Janssen (of "The Fugitive") and future "Riddler" (on the 1966-1968 "Batman" TV show) Frank Gorshin.
