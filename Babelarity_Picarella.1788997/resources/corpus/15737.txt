Angelo Peruzzi, Ufficiale OMRI (Italian pronunciation: [ˈandʒelo peˈruttsi]; born 16 February 1970 in Blera, Viterbo) is an Italian football coach and former goalkeeper, and a three-time winner of the Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year award.
He is regarded by pundits as one of the greatest Italian goalkeepers of all time, and as one of the best keepers of his generation. Throughout his career he played for Italian clubs Roma, Verona, Juventus, Internazionale, and Lazio. He had a highly successful spell with Juventus, where he won three Serie A titles, the Coppa Italia, the UEFA Cup, and the UEFA Champions League, among other titles; he won a second Coppa Italia with Lazio before retiring with the club in 2007. At international level, he played 31 times for the Italy national football team from his debut in 1995, and was a member of their squad which won the 2006 FIFA World Cup. He also represented them at the 1992 Olympics, at UEFA Euro 96 (as a starting goalkeeper), and at UEFA Euro 2004.
Because of his stocky physique, he was given the nicknames Tyson, in reference to the boxer Mike Tyson's similarly powerful build, and The Boar.
Peruzzi began his Serie A career with A.S. Roma in 1987. He was loaned to Hellas Verona in 1989, but was one of the two A.S. Roma players (the other being Andrea Carnevale) to be suspended for a year in October 1990, after failing a doping test because of an appetite suppressant he was taking at the time, which contained the banned substance Phentermine. His signing with Juventus in 1991 successfully revived his career, and he soon surpassed Stefano Tacconi as the club's starting keeper, remaining with the team until 1999, and winning the Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year Award in 1997 and 1998, as well as the Guerin d'oro in 1997. Peruzzi won three Serie A titles, a Coppa Italia, two Supercoppa Italiana titles, a UEFA Cup, a UEFA Super Cup, an Intercontinental Cup, and was part of Juventus' 1996 Champions League title squad that defeated AFC Ajax in the final on penalties, saving two in the final shoot-out; he also reached two more consecutive Champions League finals with the Turin club, as well as a semi-final finish during his final season with the club. Peruzzi also won a runners-up medal in the 1995 UEFA Cup Final and in the 1992 Coppa Italia Final, and was voted to the ESM Team of the Year during the 1996–97 and the 1997–98 seasons.
After leaving the Turin club in 1999, Peruzzi spent one unsuccessful season with Internazionale, under his former Juventus manager Marcello Lippi, finishing the league season in fourth place, and reaching the Coppa Italia Final.
The following season, he transferred to Lazio for €17.9 million, and made over 200 appearances in Serie A and European competition with the club, winning the Supercoppa Italiana in 2000, and the Coppa Italia in 2004.
Although his contract with the Biancocelesti ran until 2008, Peruzzi announced that he would end his career at the end of the 2006–07 season after Lazio's 0–0 draw with Cagliari Calcio on 15 October 2006. "I will retire at the end of the campaign," he said. "I know the Lazio president and fans will not be happy but had I not made this decision, I would remain at the club for another six or eight years." He later backtracked on this decision, claiming that his comments were a joke and that it was premature to talk about retirement at this early stage of the season, emphasizing that his potential retirement was being considered "one season at a time."
After the 0–0 draw with Roma 29 April 2007, Peruzzi confirmed that he had indeed played his last match due to the frustration of nagging injuries: "I made this decision in January. Not only was this my last Rome derby, but it could well be my last game in Serie A. I don't believe I will play the remaining matches this season. I've already had to have an injection three times in one of my fingers because of a fracture. I can't continue with them." Nonetheless, he was put on for the final few minutes in Lazio's final home match of the season, a goalless draw against Parma F.C. on 20 May as a goodbye to the fans. He was named the Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year for the third time in his career on 28 January 2008.
Peruzzi was capped 31 times in 11 years with Italy, between 1995 and 2006. He was also a member of the national squad that competed at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, making two appearances during the tournament. Peruzzi made his senior debut under manager Arrigo Sacchi, in a 4–1 home win over Estonia, in an UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying match, on 25 March 1995, and he was named Italy's starting goalkeeper at Euro 96, although Italy suffered a group-stage elimination. He was scheduled to be the starter at the 1998 FIFA World Cup under Cesare Maldini, but suffered a late injury and was replaced by Gianluca Pagliuca.
After the 1998 World Cup, Maldini was replaced by Italy's former goalkeeper and record-setter Dino Zoff, who confirmed Peruzzi as first-choice keeper during his first year as Italy's coach. Nonetheless, after a match against Norway in 1999, Zoff decided to give Gianluigi Buffon the starting spot, and Peruzzi, who was overtaken even by Francesco Toldo, decided not to participate in the Euro 2000 as the third keeper.
A similar situation arose prior to the 2002 World Cup: Italy's coach Giovanni Trapattoni wanted to call up Peruzzi as the team's third goalkeeper for the competition, but Peruzzi refused, saying, "The mascots for the World Cup have already been chosen." Two years later, though, he was called up as the third keeper behind Buffon and Toldo at Euro 2004. He didn't start for Italy again until a friendly against Spain on 28 April 2004, then was the first choice for a pair of World Cup qualifiers against Scotland and Belarus in August 2005 while Buffon was shelved with a shoulder injury.
Peruzzi served as second keeper behind Buffon in the 2006 FIFA World Cup as Italy won for the fourth time. Even though he didn't take the field, he played an important role with his leadership and experience, said his teammate Daniele De Rossi. He retired from international football after the tournament.
A powerful, athletic, and consistent goalkeeper, Peruzzi was renowned for his strength, positioning, and reactions, as well as his speed and agility, despite his physique; he particularly excelled at rushing off his line to parry the ball on the ground.
After his retirement, Peruzzi worked in the Italian national team staff as one of Marcello Lippi's collaborators. Then he was appointed Ciro Ferrara's assistant in the Under-21 team and, in 2012, he followed him at Sampdoria in Serie A.
