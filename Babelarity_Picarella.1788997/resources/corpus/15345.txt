Felcsút is a village in Fejér county, Hungary. Óbarokpuszta is attached to the village.
Prime Minister Viktor Orbán grew up in Felcsút.
The village was first mentioned in 1269 where its name was originated from the personal name "Csút". ("fel-" ["felső"] means "upper" in Hungarian.) In the Middle Ages the owners were crusaders from Székesfehérvár and in the 15th century became property of the Pálos rend.
Owners and inhabitants were often changed between the 16th century and 19th century.
The Roman Catholic church was built in classicist style between 1828 and 1840, and the Reformed church was finished by 1895.
A big change was the building of the railway which connected the village to the rest of the country, which was discontinued since.
In 2009 Felcsút became the richest Hungarian settlement by capita (171 092 HUF), pushing 2nd and 12th district of Budapest to the 2nd and 3rd place. In 2008 Felcsút was standing in the 336th place.
The development of Felcsút is a pet project of the prime minister Viktor Orbán. During Orbán's tenure as PM, several building projects were initiated or completed in the village, including Pancho Arena, a football stadium next to a property owned by Orbán, which was built in 2014 (the stadium has 3,900 seats, which is more than double of Felcsút's population), and a narrow-gauge train line, planned to be completed by 2019. In early 2014 plans of construction of a new airport were reported, these rumors turned out to be false, as the building permit posted on the local government's website is of an earlier date and refers to an already existing airport, owned by Péter Besenyei.
