The village church of St. Blasius was built in 1515 in the gothic style. In 1545 the Protestant Reformation reached the village and in 1574-82 the reformer and historian Ulrich Campell worked in Tschlin. In 1856 a fire destroyed much of the village, including the Church of St. John the Baptist. The church was not rebuilt, but the church tower is still visible in the village.
