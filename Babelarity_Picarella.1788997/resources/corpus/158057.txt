Latrobe /leɪˈtroʊb/ is a city in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania in the United States and part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.
The city population was 8,338 as of the 2010 census (9,265 in 1990). It is located near Pennsylvania's scenic Chestnut Ridge. Latrobe was incorporated as a borough in 1854, and as a city in 1999. The current Mayor is Rosemarie M. Wolford.
Among its claims to fame, Latrobe is the home of Saint Vincent Archabbey , the Latrobe Brewery (the original brewer of Rolling Rock beer), Saint Vincent College and golfer Arnold Palmer. It was the childhood home of Fred Rogers, children's television personality who was buried there in Unity Cemetery after his death in 2003. In addition, it is the birthplace of trumpeter Dennis Ferry. While it was believed for years that the first professional football game was played in Latrobe, the city's claim was refused induction into the Hall of Fame records. Latrobe is home of the first banana split, invented in Latrobe by David Strickler in 1904. Latrobe is also home to the training camp of the six time Super Bowl champion, Pittsburgh Steelers.
In May 2006, Anheuser-Busch purchased the Rolling Rock brands, but not the brewery. In June 2006, City Brewing Company from La Crosse, Wisconsin entered into negotiations to buy the brewery. In September 2006, City Brewing Company agreed to purchase the brewery, and they licensed it to the Boston Beer Company in April 2007 as a satellite brewery to produce Samuel Adams beers. Sam Adams production did not last long. The plant is currently brewing Iron City Beer under contract. In addition, Duquesne Bottling Company has brewed the revived Duquesne Beer, "The Prince of Pilseners", at the Latrobe plant.
In 1852, Oliver Barnes (a civil engineer for the Pennsylvania Railroad) laid out the plans for the community that was incorporated in 1854 as the Borough of Latrobe. Barnes named the town for his best friend and college classmate, Benjamin Latrobe, who was a civil engineer for the B&O Railroad. (His father, Benjamin Henry Latrobe, was the architect who rebuilt the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. after the War of 1812.)
Its location along the route of the Pennsylvania Railroad helped Latrobe develop into a significant industrial hub. Latrobe was also served by the Ligonier Valley Railroad from 1877 to 1952.
In 1904, the banana split was invented in Latrobe by David Evans Strickler at Strickler's Drug Store.
Two interurban (long-distance trolley) lines served Latrobe: The Westmoreland County Railway Company connected Latrobe to Derry, operating 1904 to 1932. Also, Latrobe Street Railway Company began operations in 1900, connecting Latrobe to Kingston. That line was purchased by West Penn Railways, which eventually linked it with its network running through Youngstown, Pleasant Unity, and eventually to Greensburg and Uniontown. Service ceased in 1952.
Latrobe has two sites on the National Register of Historic Places within its city boundaries:
Pennsylvania Railroad Station at Latrobe (325 McKinley Avenue): This station was built by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1903.
Citizens National Bank of Latrobe (816 Ligonier Street): At six stories, this is the city’s tallest building, previously known as the Mellon Bank Building. This 1926 structure was designed by the Greensburg firm of Batholomew & Smith.
From 1895 until 1909, Latrobe was the home of the Latrobe Athletic Association, one of the earliest professional football teams. The team's quarterback, John Brallier, became the first football player to admit playing for money. In 1895 he accepted $10 and expenses to play for Latrobe in a 12-0 victory over the Jeannette Athletic Club. Brallier was thought to be the very first professional football player, until the 1960s. It was then, that documents surfaced showing that William "Pudge" Heffelfinger, a former three-time All-American from Yale, was employed to play guard for the Allegheny Athletic Association three years earlier. In 1897, Latrobe was the first football team to play a full season with a team composed entirely of professional players. In 1898 Latrobe and two players from their rivals, the Greensburg Athletic Association, formed the very first professional football all-star team for a game against the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club, to be played at Pittsburgh's Exposition Park. Duquesne went on to win the game 16-0. On November 18, 1905, Latrobe defeated the Canton Bulldogs, which later became a founding member, and two-time champion, of the National Football League, 6-0.
Aside from Brallier, the Latrobe Athletic Association included several of the era's top players, such as: Ed Abbaticchio, Charles Barney, Alf Bull, Jack Gass, Walter Okeson, Harry Ryan, Doggie Trenchard, Eddie Wood and manager Dave Berry.
