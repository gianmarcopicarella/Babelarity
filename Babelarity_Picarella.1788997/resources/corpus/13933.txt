Hans Pontus Farnerud (born 4 June 1980) is a Swedish former footballer who played as a midfielder.
In a 17-year senior career, he played for Landskrona BoIS and Göteborg in his country, also competing professionally in France, Portugal and Norway.
Farnerud gained 11 caps for Sweden, during eight years.
Farnerud was born in Helsingborg, and grew up in Landskrona. After starting professionally at 16 with Landskrona BoIS, he was acquired in 1999 by French club AS Monaco FC, and appeared in 15 Ligue 1 matches as the team won the 2000 national title. After spending the 2003–04 season on loan to fellow league side RC Strasbourg he returned, playing six games in the UEFA Champions League and scoring once in the league, after only one minute on the pitch for a 2–1 home win against FC Nantes.
In June 2005, Farnerud was bought definitely by Strasbourg, reuniting with younger brother Alexander. The pair (with Pontus only missing six league contests) could not prevent a final relegation, as second from the bottom.
Afterwards, Farnerud moved to Sporting Clube de Portugal on a free transfer, being scarcely used during his two-year stint. He then returned north to Norway, signing a long-term contract with Stabæk Fotball on 23 July 2008. He helped to a national championship in his debut campaign, eventually being named team captain.
Farnerud spent his two last seasons as a professional back in his homeland, with IFK Göteborg. In late 2013, he retired from the game due to a recurrent hip injury, but returned the following year with amateurs Glumslövs FF (seventh division).
Farnerud was a Swedish international from 13 February 2002 to 23 January 2010, making his debut in a 2–2 friendly away draw against Greece where he featured 29 minutes. He was a participant at the 2002 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2004, but did not leave the bench on either occasion.
Farnerud's younger brother, Alexander, was also a footballer. He too was a midfielder and a Swedish international.
After retiring, Farnerud worked as a French League pundit for the TV company C More Entertainment.
