Cres is a Croatian town found on the Island of Cres which can be found directly off the Istrian Peninsula and in the Kvarner Gulf. The town is inhabited by 2,959 people (2001), and located at 44.96015°N 14.40811°E﻿ / 44.96015; 14.40811.
Cres is basically a city on the bay, as its town docks come directly into the middle of the city and are filled with boats. There is a car park at the entrance to the city, along with multiple restaurants and a gas station. Upon entering the city through one of the gates there are narrow paths you must walk through, of houses and small stores. In the center there is an open piazza, with people selling different homemade goods. There are also shops and open air restaurants in which people can sit on the edge and watch the boats come in.
Cres is home to a Blue-Flag-status marina, that is on the outskirts of the city. This is separate from the concrete center docks seen inside the actual city. The marina is home to ships of many people on the island and is also home to a dry dock where many ships are repaired. The Adriatic Sea is great for fishing and this port is important to the industry.
