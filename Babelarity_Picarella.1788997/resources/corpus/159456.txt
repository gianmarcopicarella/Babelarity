Siliguri ( pronunciation ) is a city located in the Darjeeling district, Jalpaiguri district and Kalimpong district in the Indian state of West Bengal. The city is located on the banks of the Mahananda River and the foothills of the Himalayas. Siliguri lies 42 kilometers away from its twin city, Jalpaiguri, which both merges up to be the largest metropolis of the region.
The city of Siliguri began on the banks of the Mahananda River at Saktigarh, a small town which is now in the southern part of the city. When the British East India Company introduced railways to Northeast India, it enhanced the importance of the region. The population of the town continuously increased leading to its expansion because of many immigrants from Bangladesh, and adjacent Indian states.
