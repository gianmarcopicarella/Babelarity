Émile Veinante (12 June 1907 in Metz – 18 November 1983 in Dury, Somme) was a French footballer and coach.
Veinante was primarily a forward. He began his club career in 1916 with the youth squad at FC Metz, which was at that time (before the end of the First World War) still in German-controlled Alsace-Lorraine. He stayed with FC Metz until 1929, when he moved to Racing Club de Paris in the French first division from 1929–1940, with whom he won the French Double in 1936, winning the national championship and the cup title. He was named French player of the year in that year. He retired from professional club soccer in 1940.
Between February 1929 and January 1940 Veinante played 24 international matches for the French national team, scoring 14 goals. He appeared in the 1930 and 1938 World Cups, and as a reserve in 1934. In 1938, against Belgium, he scored a goal in the first minute of play.
In 1940 Veinante became manager of Racing Paris, until 1943. He also managed Racing Club de Strasbourg from 1945–1947 and 1948–49, OGC Nice in 1949–50, FC Metz in 1950–51, FC Nantes from 1951–1955, and RC Strasbourg again in 1960–61.
