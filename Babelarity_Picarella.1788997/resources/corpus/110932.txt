Prince Maximilian of Saxony (Maximilian Maria Joseph Anton Johann Baptist Johann Evangelista Ignaz Augustin Xavier Aloys Johann Nepomuk Januar Hermenegild Agnellis Paschalis; Dresden, 13 April 1759 – Dresden, 3 January 1838) was a German prince and a member of the House of Wettin. He was the sixth but third and youngest surviving son of Frederick Christian, Elector of Saxony and Princess Maria Antonia Walpurgis of Bavaria.
Since he was the youngest son of the family, Maximilian initially had little chance to inherit the Electorate of Saxony. However, by 1800, Maximilian was the third in line to the Electorate, because all the children of his two older brothers, Frederick Augustus and Anthony, died in infancy, except Maria Augusta, Frederick Augustus's only surviving offspring. After the creation of the Kingdom of Saxony in 1806, Maximilian became a Prince of Saxony.
After the death of Frederick Augustus in 1827, Anthony succeeded him as King. Maximilian became first in line to the Saxon throne as Hereditary Prince (German: Thronfolger). However, three years later, on 1 September 1830, during the Autumn Disturbances, he renounced his rights of succession in favour of his eldest son, Frederick Augustus. He died eight years later, aged seventy-nine.
In Parma on 22 April 1792 (by proxy) and again in Dresden on 9 May 1792 (in person), Maximilian married firstly, the Princess Caroline of Bourbon (Carolina Maria Teresa Giuseppa), daughter of Ferdinand, Duke of Parma and Archduchess Marie Amalie of Austria, a sister-in-law of his uncle Albert, Prince of Saxony and Duke of Teschen. Maxilimian and Caroline had seven children:
