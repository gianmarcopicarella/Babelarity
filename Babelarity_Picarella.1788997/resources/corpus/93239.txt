The Ixodidae are a family of ticks containing the hard ticks.
They are distinguished from the other main family of ticks, the soft ticks (Argasidae) by the presence of a scutum or hard shield. In both the nymph and the adult, a prominent capitulum (head) projects forwards from the animal's body; in the Argasidae, conversely, the capitulum is concealed beneath the body.
Of the 702 species in 14 genera, some are of considerable economic importance as vectors of diseases caused by bacteria such as Rickettsia and Borrelia.
The family contains these genera:
