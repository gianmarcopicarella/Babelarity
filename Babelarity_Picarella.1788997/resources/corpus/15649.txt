Baye Djiby Fall (born 20 April 1985 in Thiès) is a Senegalese footballer who plays as a striker for FC Irtysh Pavlodar in the Kazakhstan Premier League. Fall has previously played professional for top-flight clubs in Denmark, United Arab Emirates, Russia, Norway and Belgium. In Norway he was the top goalscorer in Tippeligaen with his 16 goals for Molde.
Fall moved to France at the age of 18, where he joined Auxerre's academy. After spells at the French club AS Vitré, Danish club Randers FC and Emirati club Al Ain FC he joined Odense Boldklub in January 2008 where he was named the best player in the Danish Superliga. After 18 goals in 33 matches for OB the Senegalese top striker moved to Russian club Lokomotiv Moscow.
After playing 11 matches for Lokomotiv Moscow without scoring any goals, he was loaned out to Norwegian club Molde on 25 January 2010. Molde's head coach Kjell Jonevret said that even though Fall was bigger and stronger, and a different kind of player then Mame Biram Diouf, he was considered a replacement for the player who was transferred to Manchester United. Fall's loan-deal lasted until 30 August 2010, with an option to buy. In July 2010, Molde extended the loan-deal to the end of the 2010-season and Fall went on to become top scorer of Tippeligaen (the Norwegian top division) for the 2010 season, despite a lower half finish for Molde. Fall became the first Molde-player since Odd Berg in 1976 with this achievement. Fall was later loaned out to his old club OB, and in the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League, he scored with his final move in the 93rd minute to dump Fulham out of the competition following a 2–2 draw.
In January 2012, Fall joined the Belgium club Lokeren. In August 2012, he was signed as a replacement for Olivier Occéan in the German club Greuther Fürth, who had been promoted to the Bundesliga for the first time. Germany became the eighth country Fall had been playing football in the last eight years. Fall played two matches without scoring a goal during his first season in Germany, and after the season Greuther Fúrth was trying to sell Fall to another club. He returned to his old club Randers on the last day of the transfer window.
In February 2016, Fall went on trial with Kazakhstan Premier League side FC Irtysh Pavlodar, signing for them on 3 March 2016.
After initially announcing the release of Fall on 1 July 2016, FC Irtysh Pavlodar announced on 6 July 2016 that due to a ban imposed on them registering new players Fall would continue playing for the club.
