Mount Subasio is a mountain of the Apennine mountains, in the province of Perugia, Umbria, central Italy. On its slopes are located the ancient towns of Assisi and Spello.
The mountain stands about 1290 metres above sea level.
Its pink colored stones were used for many Franciscan buildings at the World Heritage site of Assisi. The area is included in the natural park Parco del Monte Subasio.
Castle Sasso Rosso ("Redrock") on the slope of Mount Subasio was the site of Saint Clare of Assisi and Saint Agnes of Assisi's childhood since according to tradition they were the daughters of Favorino Scifi, Conte of Sasso-Rosso, the wealthy representative of an ancient Roman family, who owned a large palace in Assisi as well.
The Benedictine Abbot of St. Benedict of Monte Subasio gave the little church of Porziuncola around 1208 to St. Francis of Assisi, on condition of making it the mother house of his religious family.
