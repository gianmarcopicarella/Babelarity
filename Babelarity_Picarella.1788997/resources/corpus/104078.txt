St. Clair Shores is a suburban city bordering Lake St. Clair in Macomb County of the U.S. state of Michigan. It forms a part of the Metro Detroit area, and is located approximately 13 miles (21 km) northeast of downtown Detroit. The population was 59,715 at the 2010 census. The current mayor is Kip C. Walby, and the current council members are John D. Caron, Ronald J. Frederick, Peter A. Rubino, Candice B. Rusie, Anthony G. Tiseo, and Christopher M. Vitale.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 14.28 square miles (36.99 km2), of which 11.62 square miles (30.10 km2) is land and 2.66 square miles (6.89 km2) is water. A notable feature of St. Clair Shores is its 14 miles (23 km) of canals. Most of these canals are found in the Nautical Mile, which is along Jefferson between 9 and 10 Mile.
The area was inhabited by French settlers as early as 1710, at which time it was called L'anse Creuse. (L'anse Creuse was also the name of a stop on the now-defunct interurban railroad off of Jefferson Ave near Nine Mile Road, and the name lives on today in the L'Anse Creuse Public Schools in central Macomb County, MI and L'Anse Creuse High School in Harrison Twp.)
From 1843 until 1911, St. Clair Shores was a part of Erin Township, parts of which make up today's Eastpointe, Roseville, and St. Clair Shores. In 1911, the eastern portion of the township now occupied by St. Clair Shores was partitioned from Erin Township to become Lake Township. Lake Township existed until 2009, when residents of the village of Grosse Pointe Shores (that portion of Grosse Pointe Shores in Macomb County located within Lake Township) voted to incorporate as a city.
A community called Eagle Pointe was established along the part of the lakeshore in 1916.
The city once was home to an amusement park named Jefferson Beach. Built in 1927, it featured the longest roller coaster in the United States. In 1955, a fire destroyed several buildings in the park. While Jefferson Beach attempted to rebuild, its owners slowly converted the park to a marina. In 1959, the remaining amusement park buildings were demolished to make room for the marina.
With help from its location along the shores of Lake Saint Clair, St. Clair Shores grew from a resort community to a suburban city rapidly after World War II. Prior to the city's incorporation in 1951, St. Clair Shores was recognized as the largest village in the United States.
The tallest building in St. Clair Shores is the 28-story Shore Club Highrise, known locally as "9 Mile Tower", located on Nine Mile Road and Jefferson Avenue near Lake Saint Clair.
Each year, St. Clair Shores hosts a popular Memorial Day Parade, which includes many of the local sports teams and marching bands. The city is also known for its "Nautical Mile" - a strip of Jefferson Avenue between Nine Mile and 10 Mile roads featuring many retail establishments, restaurants, boat dealers, and marinas.
St. Clair Shores is home to one of the longest running local pageants as a member of the Miss America Organization. The Miss St. Clair Shores program offers scholarships to young women in the community ages 17–24. The pageant itself is held in July at the local South Lake High School, located near 9 mile and Mack Ave. Miss St. Clair Shores volunteers and serves her city during her preparation to compete at the Miss Michigan Pageant.
The city is also known for its connection to Detroit's musical history. Notable locations include the now closed Car City Records, which was located on Harper between 8 and 9 Mile roads (whose employees have included many from the Detroit music scene) and the Crows Nest East, a popular music venue in the 1960s which was located on Harper and 13 Mile Road. Many groups who played here went on to regional or national fame later.
St. Clair Shores is also well known for its hockey association, with more state championships than any other rink in the entire state. High school hockey during the 1970s dominated the competition; one team from Lakeview even went undefeated in 1973, and won the championship. There are still signs and vintage Hockeytown bumper stickers hanging inside the arena.
Being situated on the western shores of Lake Saint Clair, the city's name is taken from the lake. An expedition led by the French explorer René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle named it Lac Sainte-Claire, because they entered the lake on August 12, 1679, the feast day of Saint Clare of Assisi. The lake is named on English maps as early as 1710 as Saint Clare. But as early as the Mitchell Map in 1755, the spelling is presented with the current spelling as St. Clair. The name is sometimes attributed as honoring the American Revolutionary War General and Governor of the Northwest Territory Arthur St. Clair, but the name was in use with the current spelling long before St. Clair was a notable figure. However it is possible that earlier name of the lake was conflated with that of the general in naming some of the political entities near the lake and the river, such as St. Clair County St. Clair Township, and the cities of St. Clair and St. Clair Shores.
The origin of the name has also been confused with that Patrick Sinclair, a British officer who purchased land on the St. Clair River at the outlet of the Pine River. There, in 1764, he built Fort Sinclair, which was in use for nearly twenty years before being abandoned.
