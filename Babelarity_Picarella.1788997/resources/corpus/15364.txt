The Hannover Scorpions are a professional ice hockey team, which plays in the Oberliga, Germany's third tier ice hockey league. They previously played in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga from 1996 to 2013.
Founded in 1975 as ESC Wedemark, the team was renamed Wedemark Scorpions in their first DEL season in 1996 after the rock band Scorpions, who also call Hanover, Lower Saxony their home. The next season, the Scorpions relocated to Hannover and began playing their home games at the TUI Arena in 2000.
Despite playing in the region's top venue, as well as enjoying sizeable corporate and political support, the team has struggled to generate sustained interest in Hannover.
Before relocating there in 1997, the Scorpions played their home games in Mellendorf, a small town located 20 km north in Wedemark township. They were actually considered rivals of Hannover. Thus, many local fans resent their longtime foe taking over the Hannover market at the expense of the city's historic hockey team, the less-favored Indians, and still refuse to support the Scorpions.
With the club stricken by financial problems at the conclusion of the 2012–13 season, the Scorpions were forced to sell their DEL license to 2nd Bundesliga club the Schwenningen Wild Wings on June 14, 2013. The Scorpions were then placed in the Oberliga, Germany's third tier league, due to the hiatus of the 2nd Bundesliga for the 2013–14 season.
