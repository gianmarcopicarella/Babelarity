Glen Robert Moss (born 19 January 1983) is a New Zealand goalkeeper who plays in the A-League for Wellington Phoenix, and has represented New Zealand at international level.
In August 2007, Moss signed a two-year contract with A-League new-comers, the Wellington Phoenix as their starting goalkeeper. In his first season he made 20 appearances out of the 21 league games and earned a reputation as a top goalkeeper, and was seen as one of the league's best shot-stoppers. However, injuries and dips in form during 2008–09 saw him share the starting jersey with fellow All Whites goalkeeper Mark Paston, making just 13 appearances and keeping 3 clean sheets.
After impressive performances for club and country, Moss attracted interest from A-League champions Melbourne Victory. Moss signed with the Victory for the 2009–10 season as their first choice goalkeeper, but lacklustre performances midway through the season after featuring in the opening 14 rounds of the season saw him overtaken by young-gun Mitchell Langerak as the Melbourne No. 1.
On 19 July it was announced Moss had signed a 2-year deal with Gold Coast United replacing Jess Vanstrattan who had moved to Central Coast Mariners and made his debut on 8 August 2010 against Brisbane Roar.
On 28 March 2012 it was announced he had signed a 3-year contract with A-League club Wellington Phoenix.
Moss has earned national selection at Under-20, Under-23 and All Whites international level.
He was selected for the U-23's in 2004 to compete in the 2004 OFC Men's Olympic Football Tournament, the qualification tournament for the 2004 Summer Olympics.
Moss gained his first international recognition when called up for the New Zealand squad for a friendly match against Iran in October 2003, however he did not earn his first cap until a 1–0 win over Malaysia in February the following year.
Moss was named in New Zealand's 2009 Confederations Cup squad to travel to South Africa where he played in all three games against Spain, South Africa and Iraq, where he kept a clean sheet and earned the All Whites a 0–0 draw – New Zealand's first point in a major FIFA competition.
In November 2008, Moss was handed a 4-match World Cup ban after swearing at referee Lencie Fred in a dead-rubber 2010 World Cup qualification match against Fiji. He was replaced by Mark Paston for the two World Cup play-off matches against Bahrain at the end of 2009. Following New Zealand's qualification for the World Cup, the ban meant Moss would miss the opening two group games.
On 10 May 2010, Moss was named in New Zealand's final 23-man squad to compete at the World Cup, but saw no action as in a reversal of roles, Paston played all of the All Whites' three games, keeping a clean sheet in the final game against Paraguay as the team missed out on a place in the last 16 despite remaining unbeaten.
