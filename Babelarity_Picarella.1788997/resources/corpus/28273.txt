Jacksons International Airport (IATA: POM, ICAO: AYPY), also known as Port Moresby Airport, is located 5 miles (8 kilometres) outside Port Moresby, in Papua New Guinea. It is the largest and busiest airport in Papua New Guinea and is the main hub for Air Niugini, the national airline of Papua New Guinea, as well as the main hub for Airlines PNG. It replaced the original Port Moresby airport, in what is now the suburb of Waigani, whose airstrip remained until the 1990s but no trace of which is now there, it having been built over.
Jacksons International Airport consists of two terminals, the Domestic Terminal, housing Air Niugini and Airlines PNG, and the International Terminal, servicing all other airlines plus Air Niugini and Airlines PNG's international routes. The International Terminal features four aircraft parking bays, three of which are equipped with aerobridges. The two terminals are linked by a covered walkway.
Air Niugini has its head office in the Air Niugini House, on the airport property.
On 11 August 2009, Airlines PNG Flight 4684, flying from Jacksons International Airport, crashed into a mountain while attempting a go around at Kokoda Airport, Papua New Guinea. All 11 passengers and 2 crew died in the accident.
