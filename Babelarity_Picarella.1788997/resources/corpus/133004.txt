The Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint John's—Basseterre (Latin: Dioecesis Sancti Ioannis Imatellurana) is a diocese of the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church in the Caribbean. The diocese encompasses the islands of Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Montserrat, Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands. The diocese is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Castries, and a member of the Antilles Episcopal Conference.
The diocese was erected in January 1971 and unlike many other dioceses, it has two cathedrals: Holy Family Cathedral in St John's, Antigua and the Co-Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Basseterre, St Kitts.
Both cathedrals are the seat of the bishop, the Most Rev. Kenneth Richards. Before the appointment of Bishop Kenneth Richards, Bishop Gabriel Malzaire of the Diocese of Roseau, Dominica was the Apostolic Administrator of the Diocese, following the departure of Archbishop Donald J Reece in 2009. Bishop Kenneth Richards has been appointed the 7th Archbishop of Kingston, Jamaica. He is to be installed the 7th of July. On this day the Most Rev. Robert Llanos, Auxiliary Bishop of Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago will be appointed Apostolic Administrator.
