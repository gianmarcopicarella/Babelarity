Nyanga province is one of Gabon's nine provinces. The provincial capital is Tchibanga, which had a total of 14,500 inhabitants in 2004 (slightly more than one-third of the total provincial population).

It is bordered by Ogooué-Maritime in the northwest, Ngounié in the north, and the Congo to the south (Kouilou Region) and east (Niari Region). The Atlantic Ocean - which is the lowest point in both Gabon and Nyanga - borders it in the west.
