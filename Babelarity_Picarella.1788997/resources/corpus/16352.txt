Kim Yuna (Hangul: 김연아, Hanja: 金姸兒, IPA: [gimjʌna]; born 5 September 1990, KTM) is a former South Korean figure skater. She is the 2010 Olympic champion and 2014 silver medalist in ladies' singles; the 2009, 2013 World champion; the 2009 Four Continents champion; a three-time (2006–2007, 2007–2008, 2009–2010) Grand Prix Final champion; the 2006 World Junior champion; the 2005 Junior Grand Prix Final champion; and a six-time (2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2013, 2014) South Korean national champion.
Kim is the first South Korean figure skater to win a medal at an ISU Junior or Senior Grand Prix event, ISU Championship, and the Olympic Games. She is the first female skater to win the Olympic Games, the World Championships, the Four Continents Championships and the Grand Prix Final. She is one of the most highly recognized athletes and media figures in South Korea. As a result of her numerous accomplishments, she is frequently referred to as "Queen Yuna" by various media across the world.
She is the current record holder for ladies in the combined total under the ISU Judging System. She has broken world record scores 11 times under the ISU Judging System since 2007, eight of which being records she herself set. She is also the first female skater to surpass the 140-point and 150-point free skating mark and the 200-point total mark under the ISU Judging System. Throughout her entire career, Kim had never finished a competition off the podium.
Kim was born in 1990 in Bucheon, Gyeonggi-do, and moved to Gunpo when she was six years old. She trained initially in South Korea before moving to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in May 2007 where she spent four years. She currently trains in Seoul, South Korea.
The correct transliteration of her name, 김연아, would be "Kim Yeona". However, when Kim applied for her passport, she intended to write her name as "Yun-a", but the official miswrote her name as "Yu-na", which is written as "유나" rather than "연아". From the 2010–2011 season, her name was registered as "Yuna Kim" at her ISU profile.
Yuna became a Roman Catholic in 2008 after she was healed from severe skating injuries incurred in 2006-2007 from a devout Catholic doctor and wearing a Miraculous Medal on her skating outfit she received from a nun during the 2007 World Figure Skating Championships. Her Confirmation name is Stella from "Stella Maris" in Latin, meaning Our Lady, Star of the Sea, an ancient title of The Blessed Virgin Mary. She makes the Sign of the Cross and wears a rosary ring during competitions.
Kim donated more than 3.1 billion won ($2.67 million) as of April 2015 and is continuing her effort in many ways.
Kim began skating at the age of 5. Her coach at the time, Ryu Jong-hyun, strongly suggested to Kim's mother that Kim should continue to skate, predicting that she would become a world-class figure skater in the future. In a 2011 interview, she gave credit to her coaches for noticing her aptness for skating, "My coaches have told me my muscles and body structure are perfect for skating. I was born with a good instrument, maybe more so than the talent. I was lucky my coaches noticed early on and helped me develop that. A lot of people don't know they are born that way."
During her junior years, South Korea has a very unfamiliar history and experience with figure skating. Describing training conditions for competitive figure skaters, Kim said in an October 2010 interview with CNN, "During my early skating years, there were not many ice rinks in Korea and even the few rinks that existed, most of them were public. Even now, when athletes want to practice, they have to use the rink very early [in the] morning or late at night. Also, as there aren't enough ice rinks to facilitate all the figure skating teams, skaters often have to train in different rinks from day to day. Furthermore, as most rinks are too cold, there is always high possibility of injury." 
In 2002, Kim competed internationally for the first time at the Triglav Trophy in Slovenia, where she won the gold medal in the novice competition. A year later, at age 12, she won the senior title at the South Korean Championships, becoming the youngest skater ever to win that title. She won her second international competition at the Golden Bear of Zagreb, a novice competition. She continued her reign as the South Korean champion in 2004.
In the 2004–2005 season, Kim competed as a junior at the ISU Junior Grand Prix. She won a silver medal at the event in China and a gold medal at the event in Hungary. She won a silver medal at the 2004–2005 Junior Grand Prix Final with an overall score of 137.75 points.
She retained her National Championship title for the third year in a row on her way to the 2005 World Junior Championships. At that competition, she won a silver medal earning 158.93 points and landed her first triple-triple combination jump in the free skating.
For the 2005–2006 season, Kim was not old enough to compete at the 2006 Olympics, instead, she competed in the 2005–2006 Junior Grand Prix and won both of her competitions in Bulgaria and Slovakia. At the 2005–2006 Junior Grand Prix Final, she won the competition 28.34 points ahead of silver medalist Aki Sawada. During her free skate, she landed seven triple jumps, including a triple flip – triple toe loop combination and a double axel – triple toe loop combination.
Kim won her fourth senior national title. At the 2006 World Junior Championships, she won the gold medal scoring 177.54 points overall, with a 24.19-point margin of victory over silver medalist Mao Asada.
In order to prepare for her senior debut in the 2006–2007 season, Kim trained extensively at the Toronto Cricket, Skating and Curling Club of Toronto, Ontario, Canada during the summer of 2006.
Kim made her senior international debut at 2006 Skate Canada where she won a bronze medal after being placed first at the short program and fourth in the free skate program with a total overall score of 168.48 points.
At the 2006 Trophée Eric Bompard, Kim received a score of 65.22 in the short program and 119.32 in the free skate, placing first both of them and won the event with 184.54 points, 10.10 points ahead of silver medalist Miki Ando. Those performances qualified Kim for the Grand Prix Final for the first time.
At the 2006 Grand Prix Final in Saint Petersburg, Russia, Kim placed third in the short program with 65.06 points and first in the free skating with 119.14. She won the Grand Prix Final earning 184.20 points, by a margin of 11.68 ahead over silver medalist Mao Asada.
Kim was forced to withdraw due to an injury at the 2007 South Korean Championships and was unable to defend her national title. In January 2007, Kim was diagnosed as being in the early stage of lumbar disc herniation (L4~L5).
Kim was selected to compete at the 2007 World Championships based on her performance during the season. Because of the placement of Choi Ji Eun the year before, South Korea had only one spot in the World Championships. During the World Championships in Tokyo, Japan, Kim won the short program with 71.95 points, setting the highest short program score ever under the ISU Judging System and consequently, a world record. She placed fourth in the long program earning 114.19 points, and finished third overall with 186.14 points, behind Japanese skaters Miki Ando and Mao Asada. Kim's placement qualified South Korea two ladies entries for the 2008 World Figure Skating Championships.
In March 2007, Brian Orser became her new full-time coach. Satisfied with the training environment in Toronto, Kim made Toronto her training home.

Kim's short program, long program and combined total scores in the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver were the highest scores ever since the ISU Judging System was created, and were automatically registered in the Guinness World Records. After the 2010 Winter Olympics, personalities such as Jacques Rogge and Hillary Clinton praised Kim's Olympic performance.
In August 2010, Kim and her coach of four years, Brian Orser, parted ways. Their split was first made known to the public by Orser's press release. Orser's dismissal was reported as "sudden and unexpected" and no explanation was given for the split. Orser made the separation public, saying he did not want it to become a distraction for his other skaters, including Americans Adam Rippon and Christina Gao. Rippon said in an interview that they had known about the situation longer than the general public, and had had time to deal with it, noting that "it hasn't affected Brian's coaching, and it certainly hasn't affected my training." Kim posted an online message accusing Orser of lying. She stated on her official website that they had been maintaining an awkward and ambiguous relationship for months and that she was perplexed by Orser's announcement. She also said that the dismissal had been her decision and that the reason behind it did not need to be made public. After the split, Orser gave several interviews regarding the end of their collaboration. On August 25, 2010, Orser caused controversy by revealing Kim's 2010–2011 competitive program information to the press without Kim and her choreographer's consent. Soon after, Kim left the rink where she had trained with Orser to train at the East West Ice Palace in Los Angeles owned by Michelle Kwan and Kwan's family. On October 5, 2010, Peter Oppegard was announced as Kim's coach.
Kim was assigned to the 2010 Cup of China and to the 2010 Cup of Russia for the 2010–2011 ISU Grand Prix season. However, she chose not to compete in the Grand Prix series to focus on the 2011 World Championships. She won the silver medal at the event after being placed first in the short program and second in the free skating with a total score of 194.50 points, 1.29 points behind Miki Ando.
She said she might miss the next Grand Prix series due to her work promoting South Korea's successful bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics. In May 2011, Kim told Around the Rings that bringing the Winter Olympics to PyeongChang would be an inspiration to young athletes in Korea. She officially stated to sit out the entire 2011-2012 season on October 18, 2011.
On July 2, 2012, Kim announced her intention to skate competitively in the 2012–13 season, with the ultimate goal of skating in the 2014 Winter Olympics. However, Kim was not invited to skate on the 2012–2013 Grand Prix circuit so she decided to participate in minor events to score enough technical points to qualify for the 2013 World Championships.
Kim left Oppegard and started training with her childhood coaches Shin Hea-sook and Ryu Jong-hyun.
Her first competition of the season was the 2012 NRW Trophy which was held in Dortmund, Germany, from December 5–9, 2012. She competed at the event to earn the minimum score required for Championship events. Kim placed first in the short program with a score of 72.27 points and also won the free skate with 129.34 to claim the gold medal. With the requirements met, Kim's agency said she would focus on Korean nationals and the World Championships.
In January 2013 due to her lack of competition in the previous season, Kim had to compete in the 2013 South Korean Championships to pick herself a spot for the 2013 World Championships. She placed first in the short program with a score of 64.97 points despite having some problems in that segment of the competition. She also won the free skate totaling 145.80 after performing a clean program where she executed a triple lutz–triple toe loop combination, a triple flip, a triple salchow, a triple lutz, a double axel–double toe loop–double loop combination, a triple salchow–double toe loop combination and a double axel. Her total score of 210.77 points was 48.89 ahead of silver medalist Park So-youn. As a result, Kim won her fifth national title and thus qualified to compete in the World Championships.
At the 2013 World Championships, Kim placed first in the short program with a score of 69.97 points after completing a triple lutz–triple toe loop combination, a triple flip and a double axel, taking the lead over Carolina Kostner from Italy by 3.11 points. She also won the free skate after executing a clean long program and earning 148.34 points. Her technical score of 74.73 and her presentation of 73.61 were both the highest of the night, and she was also the only skater of the competition to get tens in her program components. Totaling 218.31 points overall Kim claimed her second world title, surpassing the rest of the competitors by 20.42 points, which was the largest difference between gold and silver in the nine years the ISU Judging System had been used in the World Championships. Her world title secured three spots for South Korea in the ladies event for the 2014 Winter Olympics and 2014 World Championships.
In the 2013–2014 ISU Grand Prix season, Kim was assigned to compete in the 2013 Skate Canada International and in the 2013 Trophée Eric Bompard. However, on September 26 it was announced that Kim would not compete in the Grand Prix series due to a metatarsal injury to her right foot (bruised bones) from excessive training, with recovery expected to take up to six weeks.
Kim competed in 2013 Golden Spin of Zagreb in Zagreb, Croatia from December 5–8, 2013. She placed first in the short program with a score of 73.37 points and also won the free program with 131.12 points, despite falling on a triple lutz. She won the gold medal with a total score of 204.49 points, beating Miki Ando of Japan by 27.67 points.
In early January, Kim competed in the 2014 South Korean Championships. She led after a perfect short program with 80.60 points and also won the free program with 147.26 points. As a result, Kim won her sixth national title with a total score of 227.86 points.
In February 2014, Kim competed in the ladies event at the 2014 Winter Olympic Games. She performed two flawless programs during the event; both programs were intended as farewell performances of her competitive career. She led the short program and came in second in the free program. She finished with an Olympic silver medal. Controversy on the questionable judging and scoring of skaters' performances ensued after the event which garnered widespread debate among the figure skating community, mostly pointing out that Kim should have won another Olympic gold. As anticipated, Kim announced that the Olympics would mark the end of her competitive skating career.
Kim Yuna is famous for her strong technical skills, speed, consistency and mature artistry on the ice. Her programs are often commended for their great ice coverage, ease of movement, musicality and delicate interpretation.
Kim landed her first triple jump at the age of 10, and by 12, used 5 triple jumps in her programs. She landed her first triple-triple combination jump, a triple toe-triple toe combination, at age of 14 at the 2005 World Junior Championships. She is also known to practice triple axels in training.
She is well known for her signature triple-triple jump combinations including triple lutz–triple toe loop, and triple flip–triple toe loop,. She can also execute a triple lutz–double toe loop–double loop jump combination. These jumping passes were noted for their high speed entry, projectile, position and quality of running edges.
Another signature jump in her repertoire is a layback Ina Bauer or spread eagle that leads to either a double axel, a double axel–triple toe loop jump combination or a double axel–double toe loop–double loop jump combination - a difficult transition given the required shift in weight and edges. Kim Yuna personally stated that her favorite jumps are the lutz, flip and axel. Commentators and analysts consistently refer to her jumps as textbook standard. She has received +2.20 grade of execution for the quality of her jumps.

The show, which was directed by renowned Canadian choreographer David Wilson and boasted an impressive all-star cast, including the five-time world champion Michelle Kwan, the reigning Olympic champions from three skating disciplines including Kim, and many world champions, received rave reviews from both figure skating fans and critics for bringing a new style of skating show to the US and also for its overall high quality production.

On January 28, 2010, Kim published her book, Kim Yu-na's Seven-Minute Drama, about her experience with figure skating since the age of seven to the preparation of 2010 Winter Olympic in Vancouver.

Kim played a key role in South Korea's effort to win the rights to host the 2018 Winter Olympic Games. Kim was part of the Olympic Bidding Committee for PyeongChang, the Korean hosting city. The Korean committee members including Kim traveled to Durban, South Africa, where International Olympic Committee (IOC)'s decision for the hosting city was finalized on July 6, 2011. There, she fulfilled her role as Korean delegation by promoting PyeongChang as an athlete ambassador and an Olympic champion. Kim was one of the eight Korean delegates who appeared before the July 6 IOC conference and delivered a presentation for Pyeongchang, which won the hosting rights over other rival cities, Munich of Germany and Annecy of France.
