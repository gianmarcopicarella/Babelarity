493 Griseldis is a fairly dark main-belt asteroid 46 km in diameter.
Griseldis is suspected of being impacted by another asteroid in March 2015. Other asteroids suspected of an asteroid-on-asteroid impact include P/2010 A2 and 596 Scheila which also showed extended features (tails).
The asteroid was observed with the Subaru telescope (8m), the Magellan Telescopes (6.5), and also the University of Hawaii 2.2 m telescope in early 2015. The activity was detected on the Subaru in late March, and confirmed on the Magellan telescope a few days later (which is in Chile), but no activity was seen by April. Also, no activity was seen in archived images from 2010 or 2012 according to a University of Hawaii press release.
