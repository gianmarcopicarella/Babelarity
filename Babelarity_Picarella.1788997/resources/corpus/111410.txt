Princess Athena of Denmark, Countess of Monpezat (Athena Marguerite Françoise Marie; born 24 January 2012), is the youngest child and only daughter of Prince Joachim and Princess Marie of Denmark.
As of July 2016, Athena is tenth in the line of succession to the Danish throne.
Princess Athena was born at Rigshospitalet (Copenhagen University Hospital) weighing 3032 grams and was 49 cm long. When her father met the press following her birth, he joked that her name could become anything between Jo and Scheherazade.
The princess has two older half-brothers from her father's first marriage, Prince Nikolai and Prince Felix, and an older brother, Prince Henrik.
As with her older brothers and cousins, her names were not revealed until her christening, which took place on 20 May 2012 at the Møgeltønder Church, where her older brothers Felix and Henrik were also christened. At her christening, she was named Athena Marguerite Françoise Marie, after her grandmothers and mother.
Her godparents are her maternal uncles Gregory Grandet and Edouard Cavallier; long-term girlfriend of Joachim's cousin Prince Gustav, Carina Axelsson; and friends of her parents: Julie Mirabaud, Diego de Lavandeyra and Henriette Steenstrup.
Athena is styled as Her Highness Princess Athena of Denmark, Countess of Monpezat.
