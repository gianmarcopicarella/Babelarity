Reneilwe "Yeye" Letsholonyane (born 9 June 1982 in Soweto, Gauteng) is a South African football midfielder for SuperSport United F.C. and the South African national team.
He grew up kicking a tennis ball in White City, Jabavu in Soweto. His talent blossomed at Morris Isaacson High School where he started playing for Jomo Cosmos juniors. His parents did not believe that he could make a living from playing football because they knew it is a short career but they encouraged him, his first pair of soccer boots were Puma SE Rangers that his parents bought for him.
His younger brother Ruben is a soccer player. He lives in Fourways, Johannesburg. “Life in the suburbs is somewhat lonely. Everyone minds his own business. You hardly ever see neighbours chatting over the fence. “I miss the feeling that exists in the townships of being a member of one big family. Asking for a loan of sugar, washing powder or salt from the neighbour when your own runs out,” he said. Letsholonyane's father, Andrew Ramogangwane Letsholonyane died on 16 February 2015 at the age of 59.
