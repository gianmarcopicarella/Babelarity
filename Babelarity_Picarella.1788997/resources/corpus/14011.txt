Tolga Zengin (born October 10, 1983) is a Turkish football goalkeeper. He currently plays for Beşiktaş in the Turkish Süper Lig. His impressive performances at the start of the 2006–07 season for Trabzonspor earned him a call-up to the Turkey national football team squad for a friendly against Luxembourg in August 2006.
Tolga was on the Turkish squad at UEFA Euro 2008. In response to several players being unable to play due to sanctions or injuries, manager Fatih Terim hinted that he might have been called up as a field player, a testimony to his versatility.
His most successful performance was a UEFA Champions League group stage match against Internazionale in September 2011.
