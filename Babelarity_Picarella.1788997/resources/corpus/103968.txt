Hakaniemi (Finnish) or Hagnäs (Swedish) is a station on the Helsinki Metro. It serves the central Helsinki districts of Hakaniemi and Kallio.
The station was among the first metro stations opened in Helsinki, on 1 June 1982, and was designed by Mirja Castrén, Juhani Jauhiainen, and Marja Nuuttila. It is located 0.9 kilometres from the Kaisaniemi metro station, and 0.9 kilometres from the Sörnäinen metro station. The station is situated at a depth of 23 metres below ground level (21m below sea level).
Hakaniemi metro station was seen in Aki Kaurismäki's film Calamari Union, although the route planned in the storyline (from Kallio to Eira) is impossible, because neither of those stations exist. Hakaniemi metro station was also featured in Bomfunk MC's music video for the hit single "Freestyler".
