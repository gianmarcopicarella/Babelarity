The Nokia N82 is a high-end smartphone produced by Nokia, and announced on 14 November 2007 as part of the company's Nseries line. The N82 runs Symbian OS v9.2 (S60 3rd Edition, FP1). It was notable for its advanced camera with a xenon flash, beating the N95 as the best camera phone when it came out. The latest firmware is v35.0.002.
Other than the camera, the N82 does have advanced features, and has even been called as a N95 successor by some people.
The first Nokia phone with xenon flash, the N82 has a 5-megapixel camera with Carl Zeiss optics, and was considered the best camera phone on the market until the arrival of the Samsung GT-i8510.
Discussions and head to head comparisons of these two models demonstrate the N86 8MP from 2009, which is equipped with dual LED flash, is not consistently capable of outperforming the N82 in variable lighting. The primary advantage of using LED is light source for video recording, whereas the xenon flash has a stronger burst of light, but it cannot be used for recording videos due to its technical composition.
The N82 includes a built-in accelerometer for video stabilisation and photo orientation to keep landscape or portrait shots oriented as taken, and automatic 270 degree screen rotation. It is compatible with the N-Gage gaming platform. It has a 2.4-inch TFT display and features the same 332 MHz processor as found in the N95.
The mainland China market version of the N82 has a different hardware platform which has Wi-Fi and the UMTS radio removed (no 3G support), has a different product code (RM-314 as opposed to RM-313) and its firmware is incompatible with the regular model's. This version can be readily identified by the lack of "WLAN scanning" display on the idle screen.
The N86 8MP from 2009 is considered to be the N82's successor due to its high-end camera technology, despite the lack of Xenon. Effectively, the N8 from 2010 is also considered to be the successor as it combined high-end multimedia features with a Xenon flash, much like the N82. However the Nokia 6220 classic of 2008 was the second Nokia with a Xenon flash - its other features were more basic and so was not seen as a successor.
