Dante Bonfim Costa Santos (born 18 October 1983), commonly known as Dante (Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈdɐ̃tʃi]), is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays for German club VfL Wolfsburg. Primarily a central defender, he has previously also been used as a defensive midfielder or a left back.
Produced at Juventude, he went on to Lille, Charleroi and Standard Liège, winning the Belgian Pro League with the latter. In January 2009 he was signed by Borussia Mönchengladbach, spending two-and-a-half seasons before a €4.7 million move to Bayern Munich, where he won nine domestic and international honours.
Dante made his international debut for Brazil in 2013, winning that year's Confederations Cup and representing the nation at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
Dante joined Juventude's youth system in 2001 and by 2002 became a part of the club's first team setup. In 2004, he made his move to European football, signing for Lille in France. After two seasons with the club where he only featured in 12 league games, Dante moved to Belgium, signing for Charleroi in 2006. After a successful campaign in the Belgian Pro League for Charleroi where he made 27 appearances and helped the club to a respectable fifth-place finish, he moved across the country to Standard de Liège. Dante had a successful debut season with the Belgian giants as Standard were crowned league champions, the Brazilian defender proving to be an integral member, missing just one league game. In his second season with Standard, he featured in the first 15 league games of the campaign before interest from Germany sent the player to the Bundesliga.
Dante signed for German side Borussia Mönchengladbach from Standard Liège on 27 December 2008 for an undisclosed fee, signing a contract with the club until summer 2013. Dante made his debut for the club on 20 March 2009, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 1–0 loss to fellow strugglers VfL Bochum. His first goal for the club came against eventual champions VfL Wolfsburg on 11 April but it came in a losing effort as Gladbach fell 2–1 thanks to a late strike by defender Sascha Riether. The Brazilian scored a dramatic late winner against Energie Cottbus on 13 May, heading in a cross from winger Marko Marin to give the club a 1–0 win in the 91st minute. On the final day of the Bundesliga season on 23 May 2009, Dante scored Gladbach's only goal in a 1–1 draw with Borussia Dortmund, a point which meant that the club avoided immediate relegation back to the 2. Bundesliga.
In the opening fixture of the 2009–10 Bundesliga campaign on 9 August 2009, Dante received a red card for a bad foul as Mönchengladbach relinquished a 3–0 lead against VfL Bochum, drawing 3–3. He netted his first goal of the campaign on 31 October, heading home a corner in the 76th minute to draw the game level at 2–2 and an 82nd-minute strike from Rob Friend handed Gladbach a 3–2 victory over Hamburg. On 9 April 2010, Dante headed in a free-kick from Juan Arango to double Gladbach's lead, resulting in a 2–0 defeat of Eintracht Frankfurt that all but secured Bundesliga survival.
The 2010–11 campaign proved to be another difficult campaign for Gladbach. Dante only featured in 17 league games as he battled against persistent injury and the club finished in 16th place, the relegation play-off spot. He did though play the full ninety minutes in each play-off match against Bochum as Borussia Mönchengladbach managed a 2–1 aggregate victory to remain in the German top flight for the 2011–12 season.
The following season proved much more successful as Dante featured in 38 games in all competitions, playing the full ninety minutes in each game. In January 2012, Dante hinted that he could leave the club before his contract runs out in June 2014, revealing to the press that he desired to play for a top club in Germany, singling out Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and Bayer 04 Leverkusen. Dante was influential as the club made a run to the semi-finals of the DFB-Pokal where the club lost 4–2 on penalties to Bayern Munich on 21 March 2012, with Dante and Håvard Nordtveit missing their penalties to give Bayern a spot in the final with champions Borussia Dortmund.
On 26 April 2012, he agreed to join Bayern Munich at the start of the 2012–13 season for an estimated fee of €4.7 million.
Dante's first appearance for the club came in the DFL-Supercup on 12 August 2012, starting at centre-back in Bayern's 2–1 defeat of Borussia Dortmund. He made his league debut for the Bavarian giants on 25 August, as Bayern cruised to a 3–0 opening day victory over promoted side SpVgg Greuther Fürth. He scored his first competitive goal for the team in a 5–0 thrashing of Hannover 96 on 24 November 2012. Dante made an immediate impact at Bayern, earning a place in the starting XI, forming partnerships with the interchanging Holger Badstuber, Daniel van Buyten and Jérôme Boateng in the center of defense.
Following the defender's impressive start with Die Roten, coach Jupp Heynckes told media that Dante was one of the first names on the team sheet and club captain Phillip Lahm supported the manager's sentiments, stating that, "Dante is one of the best defenders I've ever played with." He secured his first league title since moving to Germany after a 1–0 defeat of Eintracht Frankfurt on 6 April 2013 and was seen celebrating with the supporters in the stands following the result. In the Champions League final against German rivals Borussia Dortmund, Dante conceded a penalty for a rash challenge, but failed to receive a red card, in an entertaining 2–1 victory for the Bavarians.
With Dante at the heart the defence, Bayern broke records for fewest goals conceded and most clean sheets in a Bundesliga season during their treble winning campaign.
In new manager Pep Guardiola's first Bundesliga game, coincidentally against Dante's former club Gladbach, the defender scored an own goal after a mix-up with goalkeeper Manuel Neuer; the game ended in a 3–1 victory for Bayern.
On 21 December 2013, Dante scored the opening goal as Bayern beat Raja Casablanca 2–0 in the final of the 2013 FIFA Club World Cup.
In February 2014, Dante scored three goals in the space of four matches for Bayern; in Bundesliga wins over Eintracht Frankfurt (5–0) and SC Freiburg (4–0) and a DFB-Pokal victory over Hamburger SV (5–0).
On 24 March 2014, Dante extended his contract with Bayern until June 2017.
On 30 August 2015, Dante agreed to move to VfL Wolfsburg for an undisclosed fee. On 13 January 2016, Dante injured Bas Dost in training.
In his time at Borussia Mönchengladbach, Dante was well known for his hair, becoming a cult hero with Borussia fans regularly sporting large afro wigs as an homage to their favourite player. Bayern fans quickly continued this tradition after the defender's move to Munich.
Dante received his first call-up to the Brazilian national team on 21 January 2013 by returning coach Luiz Felipe Scolari to be part of the squad for a friendly versus England, on 6 February at Wembley Stadium. He started the game, which England won 2–1 after goals from Wayne Rooney and Frank Lampard. On 22 June 2013, he scored his first international goal in the final group game of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup against Italy at the stroke of half time, after coming on as a substitute for David Luiz on the 33rd minute.
Dante was a member of Brazil's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, making his only appearance in the semi-final as a replacement for the suspended captain Thiago Silva, as the Seleção were defeated by Germany in a record 7–1 scoreline. In a comment regarding the defeat, he stated that he has 'been treated with "less respect."'
Dante is married and has two children.
