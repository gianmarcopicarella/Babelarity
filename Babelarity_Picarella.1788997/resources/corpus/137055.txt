In medicine, traumatology (from Greek trauma, meaning injury or wound) is the study of wounds and injuries caused by accidents or violence to a person, and the surgical therapy and repair of the damage. Traumatology is a branch of medicine. It is often considered a subset of surgery and in countries without the specialty of trauma surgery it is most often a sub-specialty to orthopedic surgery. Traumatology may also be known as accident surgery.

Factors in the assessment of wounds are:
the nature of the wound, whether it is a laceration, abrasion, bruise or burn
the size of the wound in length, width and depth
the extent of the overall area of tissue damage caused by the impact of a mechanical force, or the reaction to chemical agents in, for example, fires or exposure to caustic substances.
Forensic physicians, as well as pathologists may also be required to examine (traumatic) wounds on people.
