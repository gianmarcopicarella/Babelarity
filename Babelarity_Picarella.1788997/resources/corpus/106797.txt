Princess Martha Coast is that portion of the coast of Queen Maud Land lying between 05° E and the terminus of Stancomb-Wills Glacier, at 20° W. The entire coastline is bounded by ice shelves with ice cliffs 20 to 35 m high.
Princess Martha Coast was the first portion of Antarctic mainland discovered by a human, Fabian von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev in 1820. The name "Crown Princess Martha Land" was originally applied by Capt. Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen to that section of the coast in the vicinity of Cape Norvegia which he discovered from the Norvegia and roughly charted from the air during February 1930.
It is named in honour of Crown Princess Märtha of Norway.
Troll (research station) is located in the eastern part, 235 km from the coast.
