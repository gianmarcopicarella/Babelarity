Gran  is a municipality in Oppland county, Norway. It is part of the traditional region of Hadeland. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Jaren. There is also a village of Gran located within the municipality.
The municipality of Gran was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). Brandbu was separated from Gran on 1 January 1897, but it was merged back into the municipality of Gran on 1 January 1962.
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old Gran farm (Old Norse: Grǫn), since the first church was built there. The name is identical with the word grǫn which means "spruce".
The coat-of-arms is from modern times. They were granted on 11 December 1987. The coat-of-arms is red with two gold triangles stretching upwards with a bottony cross on the tip of each triangle. It is meant to represent the spires of the medieval Sister Churches which are located in the municipality. The arms were designed by Kari Ruud Flem from Jevnaker.
Granavollen is the site of the Sister Churches (Norwegian: Søsterkirkene), two stone churches from the Middle Ages. They are constructed side by side. The smaller and older is the Mariakirke, a single nave church built in the Romanesque style. The neighbouring Nikolaikirke is a three-aisled basilica, probably inspired by the construction of the St. Halvardskirke in Oslo. According to local folklore, the churches were built by two sisters. These two detested each other so much they could not share the same church. A more likely explanation however, is that the Mariakirke was built for the local congregation, while the Nikolaikirke was the main church for Hadeland parish. The Granavollen stone is located behind the Nikolaikirken.
At Tingelstad, there is another medieval stone church. It is dated to the 12th century and is called the Tingelstad old church. This church has survived even though it has not been in regular use for some 140 years. This is also the location of Hadeland Folkemuseum with a collection of buildings from the area, farm implements as well as a grave mound from the Viking Age and a copy of the 11th century Dynna stone. It also holds an archive of photographs and documents.
The economy of the municipality was in 2002 of NOK 24,098 in free income per inhabitant, and net debt per inhabitant was NOK 41,835 (also municipal economy, not private). Health care spendings represents about one third of the total budget, which is 7.5 per cent higher than the average for Norway.
