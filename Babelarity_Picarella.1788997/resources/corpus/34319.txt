It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. Trifolium angustifolium occurs in many types of habitat, including disturbed areas.
It can be found elsewhere as an introduced species, including an invasive species in parts of North America, such as California.
Trifolium angustifolium is an annual herb growing erect in form. The leaves are divided into narrow leaflets which are linear to lance-shaped and measure up to 4.5 centimeters long. The leaves have stipules tipped with bristles. The herbage is hairy in texture.
The inflorescence is a cylindrical spike of flowers measuring 1 to 5 centimeters long. Each flower has a calyx of sepals with long, hairy, needle-like lobes that harden into bristles as the plant dries. Within each calyx is a pink corolla about a centimeter long.
