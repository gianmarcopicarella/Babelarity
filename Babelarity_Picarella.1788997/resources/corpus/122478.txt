Mu (uppercase Œú, lowercase Œº; Ancient Greek Œº·ø¶ [m≈∑Àê], Modern Greek ŒºŒπ or ŒºœÖ [mi]) is the 12th letter of the Greek alphabet. In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 40. Mu was derived from the Egyptian hieroglyphic symbol for water (ìàñ), which had been simplified by the Phoenicians and named after their word for water, to become(mem). Letters that arose from mu include the Roman M and the Cyrillic –ú.
In Ancient Greek, the name of the letter was written Œº·ø¶ and pronounced [m≈∑Àê].
In Modern Greek, the letter is spelled ŒºŒπ and pronounced [mi]. In monotonic orthography, the ancient version is written with an acute accent instead of a circumflex: Œºœç.
The lowercase letter mu (Œº) is used as a special symbol in many academic fields. The uppercase mu is not used, because it is normally identical to Latin M.
the SI prefix micro-, which represents one millionth, or 10‚àí6
the micron, an old unit that corresponds to the micrometre (which is now denoted "¬µm")
