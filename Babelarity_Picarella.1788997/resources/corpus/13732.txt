Jeremy Russell Brockie (born 7 October 1987) is a New Zealand professional footballer who plays for SuperSport United in the South African Premier Soccer League.
He has represented New Zealand at senior international level, including the 2010 FIFA World Cup and at the 2008 Olympic Games.
Brockie started his youth football for Richmond Athletic and his senior career at Matson's Premier Football League side Nelson Suburbs before going on to play for Canterbury United in the 2004–05 season of the New Zealand Football Championship.
He was one of the few shining lights for the New Zealand Knights in their debut A-League season, scoring four competition goals from nine starts. His first goals in the A-League were a double against Newcastle Jets at North Harbour Stadium. Brockie also scored a last minute goal against Sydney FC to earn the Knights a point, with his fourth goal coming in his sides final regular season fixture against the Melbourne Victory at Olympic Park in Melbourne. Brockie ended up being joint top goalscorer for the New Zealand club along with Simon Yeo.
On 17 March 2006, the New Zealand Knights announced that Brockie had decided to leave the club and join Sydney FC on a two-year contract. Brockie failed to find a regular place in Terry Butcher's first team, included in the starting line-up just twice and figuring in only seven matches of the A-League season. Despite being named in the Sydney FC squad for the AFC Champions League, Brockie was released early from his contract on 6 March 2007 for personal reasons. In July 2007 Jeremy signed for Hawke's Bay in the NZFC, and later for Team Wellington.
In 2009 Brockie signed for new A-League expansion club North Queensland Fury for 2009–10 season. He debuted for the Fury on 17 October 2009, starting in a 1–1 draw at home against the Wellington Phoenix. Brockie scored his first goal on 9 January against Central Coast Mariners. Brockie signed for the Newcastle Jets on 30 March 2010, on a two-year contract.
On 14 May 2012 it was announced he had signed a 3-year contract with New Zealand-based A-League club Wellington Phoenix. After a prolific preason, Brockie had to wait until the Round 5 fixture against Melbourne Victory to find the back of the net, taking the shot first time on his left foot from outside the box, Brockie managed to beat the goalkeeper off the underside of the crossbar. He followed this up with a stunning free kick to complete his brace in his teams losing effort.
Brockie finished the 2012–13 season with 16 goals in 25 appearances for the Phoenix, finishing second in the A-League golden boot, a bright spot in the Phoenix's poor season where they finished in last place.
In the 2013–14 season, Brockie finished the season with 5 goals in 24 appearances, including the final goal of the season in a 1–4 home defeat to the Melbourne Victory.
Brockie was loaned to Major League Soccer club Toronto FC, where he joined manager Ryan Nelsen, a fellow New Zealander, on 7 May 2013. In his third appearance, Brockie came off the bench to provide the assist for Toronto FC's goal in the 1–1 draw with Philadelphia Union. Brockie scored his first goal with Toronto on 3 July 2013 in a 3–3 home draw to Canadian rivals Montreal Impact. Brockie's loan with Toronto FC expired after the conclusion of the club's match against D.C. United on 24 August 2013.
On 4 December 2014, Brockie signed a two-and-a-half year contract with SuperSport United F.C. in Pretoria, South Africa. In his final game for the Phoenix, Brockie scored the second and third goals in a 3–0 home win against Brisbane Roar.
Brockie arrived at SuperSport in style, scoring the only and winning goal against Mpumalanga Black Aces F.C. in his first game.
After the 2007–08 season, Brockie moved to Wellington to base himself with the majority of the New Zealand national under-23 football team in preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympics, playing his winter season with Miramar Rangers. He has since remained in Wellington, signing for Team Wellington for the 2008–09 season.
In January 2006, he received his first call-up for the All Whites, the New Zealand national team, for the series against Malaysia in February 2006. On 19 February 2006, Brockie made his international debut, coming on as a substitute and playing the last twenty minutes of New Zealand's 1–0 win over Malaysia at Christchurch's QE II Stadium. On the 2006 All Whites tour of Europe, he also made appearances off the bench against Georgia, Estonia and Brazil. Brockie has also represented New Zealand at Under-23 and Under-20 level.
On 7 August 2008, Brockie scored for the NZ U23's in the 1–1 draw against hosts China at the Olympic Football Preliminaries from a flicked ball over the defence by teammate Craig Henderson. Brockie was named as part of the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup New Zealand squad to travel to South Africa.
