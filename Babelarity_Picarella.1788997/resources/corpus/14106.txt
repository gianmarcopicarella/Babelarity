Ademir da Guia (born 3 April 1942) is a retired professional footballer who played during the 1960s and 1970s for Palmeiras, a leading association football team in Brazil, where he is still regarded as one of the club's all-time best players. Usually a playmaker, he was known for his fantastic close control and passing ability. He was nicknamed O Divino, which means The Divine One, by his supporters.
Born in Rio de Janeiro, his father, Domingos da Guia, was a former national team member who played at the 1938 FIFA World Cup. Also his uncle, Ladislau da Guia had pursued the same career path at an earlier stage playing for Bangu Atlético Clube, actually becoming that club's all-time best scorer with a total of 215 goals scored.
In the 16 years Ademir da Guia spent playing for Palmeiras, he holds the record for the most appearances for the club and is the third best goalscorer ever, and won, amongst other titles, both the Campeonato Paulista and the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A five times.
Unlike many distinguished football players in his country, Ademir did not actually have a prolonged and constant participation into the Brazilian national team; playing in nine matches for Brazil in the total: the first six in 1965 and the other three in 1974 – including at the 1974 FIFA World Cup when he actually got the chance to play only in the runners-up match for third place against Poland. His lack of playing time was partially a result of the presence of playmaker Rivelino in the Brazil team.
Ademir da Guia played his farewell match on 18 September 1977 at Estádio do Morumbi, São Paulo in a Campeonato Paulista match between his club Palmeiras and Corinthians, which the latter won 2–0.
He was elected in 2004 for the legislative period of 2005–2008 as councilman for the city of São Paulo as a member of the Communist Party of Brazil, joining the Liberal Party later.
