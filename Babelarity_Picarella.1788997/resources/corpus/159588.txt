Morton County (standard abbreviation: MT) is a county located in the U.S. state of Kansas. As of the 2010 census, the county population was 3,233. The largest city and county seat is Elkhart.
For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.
In 1848, after the Mexican-American War, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo with Spain brought into the United States all or part of land for ten future states, including southwest Kansas.
From 1821 to late 1860s, the Santa Fe Trail was active across Morton County.
In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1886, Morton County was established, and named for Oliver Morton, who was a United States Senator from Indiana from 1867 to 1877. In 1886, the community of Richfield was established as the county seat.
In the 1930s, the prosperity of the area was severely affected by its location within the Dust Bowl. This catastrophe intensified the economic impact of the Great Depression in the region.
In 1961, the county seat was moved from Richfield to Elkhart.
In 2007, the Federal Communications Commission moved Morton County into the Wichita, Kansas media market, along with the rest of western Kansas. Previously it was part of the Amarillo, Texas market.
