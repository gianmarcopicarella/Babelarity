1907 Rudneva, provisional designation 1972 RC2, is a moderately bright, stony asteroid from the main-belt, about 11 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on September 11, 1972 by Ukrainian astronomer Nikolai Chernykh at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory in Nauchnyj.
The assumed S-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.4–2.7 AU once every 4 years (1,484 days). It has a long rotation period of 44 hours and a geometric albedo of about 0.20.
It is named after Ukrainian-born Evgeniya Maksimovna Rudneva (1920–1944) a member of the Astronomical–Geodetical Society of the U.S.S.R., head of the solar department, and Hero of the Soviet Union. She voluntarily joined the army as a navigator in the all-female Night Bombers Aviation Regiment, known as the Night Witches. She died in April 1944, while flying her 645th combat mission.
