Violant of Bar (c. 1365 – 3 July 1431) was queen consort of Aragon.
She was the daughter of Robert I, Duke of Bar and Marie of Valois. Violante was the eighth of eleven children. She was married in 1380 at the age of 15 to John, Duke of Girona, the heir apparent to the throne of Aragon, thus becoming Duchess of Girona and Countess of Cervera.
Her husband became King of Aragon in 1387. He was often ill, and Violante wielded considerable administrative power on his behalf. She transformed the Aragonese court into a center of French culture. She especially cultivated the talents of Provençal troubadours (poet-musicians).
John and Violant had six children, but only one daughter, Yolande lived to adulthood.

Violant died in Barcelona on 13 August 1431 at the age of sixty-six.
