Visor om slutet (English: Songs About the End) is an all-acoustic folk metal EP by the Finnish band Finntroll. It was released in 2003 by Spinefarm. It was the first album to feature Tapio Wilska on vocals, and the last to feature Jan "Katla" Jämsen, who was forced into retirement in 2003 due to a tumour developing on his vocal cords.
Visor om slutet was released after a number of misfortunes befell several band members, including the death of guitarist Teemu Raimoranta, to whom the album is dedicated. It was recorded in a cabin off in the woods near Helsinki, coined as an "acoustic experiment," and features the use of traditionally non-metal instruments such as the kazoo. Though quite different in its sound to the folk metal-inspired Jaktens tid, the album was a relative success.
