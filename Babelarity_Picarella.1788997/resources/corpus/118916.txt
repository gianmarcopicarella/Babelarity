Xi Hydrae (ξ Hya, ξ Hydrae) is a fourth-magnitude star in the constellation Hydra. The star is situated 130 light-years from Earth and has a radius about 10 times that of the Sun. It is radiating 58 times as much luminosity as the Sun. The star is now approaching the end of its life, and has expanded its outer envelope to become a red giant star.
The star Xi Hya was particularly interesting in the field of asteroseismology when an international group of astronomers discovered that it behaves like a giant sub-ultra-bass musical instrument.
Xi Hydrae was a latter designation of 19 Crateris.
