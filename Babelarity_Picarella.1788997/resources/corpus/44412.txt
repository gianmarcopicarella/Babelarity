Shagrath (born Stian Tomt Thoresen on 18 November 1976) is a Norwegian musician best known as the vocalist of Dimmu Borgir.
Stian Thoresen was born on 18 November 1976 in Jessheim, outside Oslo, Norway.
Shagrath is one of the founding members of Dimmu Borgir, along with Silenoz and Tjodalv. Shagrath's change from playing guitar to vocals is a part of what changed the band's sound. His contributions extend into the use of keyboards, bass guitar, and drums; as can be heard on For All Tid. Since the departure of Mustis in 2009, Shagrath returned to the keyboards during the recording of Abrahadabra, but is once again only the vocalist with the addition of Gerlioz to the band's touring line-up.
Shagrath also played guitar and drums in Fimbulwinter until the band split up in 1994. Fimbulwinter released one album, Servants of Sorcery, through Hot Records in the year of 1994. Shagrath also played keyboards in another Norwegian black metal band called Ragnarok. Another unknown band was Starkness, a solo project of Shagrath. He is also the rhythm guitarist of the heavy metal band Chrome Division.
Shagrath also sports extensive tattoo work. This work includes the word Shagrath across his stomach, various arm tattoos which cover his arms as well as extend to his upper chest.
He has two daughters; Alva (born 2004) with ex-fiancé Bente, and daughter Enya (born 2013) with Silje Hagen. Shagrath was engaged to Christina Fulton, Nicholas Cages' ex, for a short period of time.
In late 2009, Shagrath joined forces with King and formed the band Ov Hell. In February 2010 the band released their first album entitled The Underworld Regime.
Shagrath has said this about his stage name: "Shagrath is an orc demon from the book Lord of the Rings. I chose the name thirteen years ago, so it's kinda crappy that Lord of the Rings has become so big now. Fortunately it [the name] didn't get that much attention in the movie, so it turned out all OK." The Tolkien character Shagrat is however not a demon, but the orc commander over Cirith Ungol.
