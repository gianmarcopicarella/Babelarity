Pablo Mastroeni (born August 29, 1976) is a retired American soccer player and current head coach of the Colorado Rapids.
Mastroeni moved to the United States from Argentina with his family at the age of four, settling in Phoenix, Arizona. He attended Thunderbird High School, and played youth soccer for the Santos Futbol Clube. Mastroeni attended North Carolina State University where he played on the men's soccer team from 1994 to 1997. From 1995 to 1997, he spent the collegiate off season playing for the Tucson Amigos of the USISL.
In February 1998, the Miami Fusion selected Mastroeni in the second round (thirteenth overall) of the 1998 MLS College Draft. He played four seasons with the Fusion, becoming a regular starter in his second year with the team in either central defense or defensive midfield, and was named to the MLS Best XI in 2001.
The Fusion was contracted after the 2001 season and Mastroeni was the first overall choice of the 2002 MLS Allocation Draft, going to the Colorado Rapids, whom he captained to their first title in 2010. Mastroeni scored his first MLS playoff goal against the Columbus Crew on October 28, 2010.
Mastroeni was traded to the Los Angeles Galaxy in June 2013 and retired at the end of the season.
Mastroeni earned his first US cap against Ecuador on June 7, 2001. When Chris Armas went out with an injury just weeks prior to the 2002 World Cup, Mastroeni found himself a starter in the opening game as the US defeated Portugal 3â€“2.
On January 10, 2005, it was reported that he tore the quadriceps in his left leg and would be out for six to eight weeks. The injury happened while training with the national team.
On May 2, 2006, Mastroeni was named to the US World Cup squad for the second time in his career. In a FIFA World Cup 2006 match against Italy on June 17, Mastroeni was given a red card for an aggressive tackle in the first half. Mastroeni was fined CHF 7,500 and received a three-game suspension, thus missing the last US match of the World Cup and the first two matches of the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup.
On February 7, 2007, during a friendly between the United States and Mexico, Mastroeni was the team captain.
Mastroeni was called up for the United States' first World Cup qualifying match of 2010 and two third-round matches, and started three of the first five final round matches for the United States. However, he was not named to the Confederations Cup roster nor any of the squads for the final five qualifiers for the United States.
Mastroeni was named head coach of the Colorado Rapids on March 8, 2014. Mastroeni led the Rapids on an interim basis since Oscar Pareja left for FC Dallas on January 10, 2014.
