789 Lena, provisional designation 1914 UU, is an asteroid from the middle region of the asteroid belt, approximately 24 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 24 June 1914, by Soviet–Russian astronomer Grigory Neujmin at Simeiz Observatory on the Crimean peninsula.
The X-type asteroid is also classified as a M-type by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.3–3.1 AU once every 4 years and 5 months (1,608 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.15 and an inclination of 11° with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. Although its orbital elements resemble those of the asteroids in the Eunomia family, true members of this family have a S-type composition, so it is almost certainly an unrelated interloper. The first used observation was made much later at the U.S Yerkes Observatory in 1935, reducing the asteroid's observation arc by 21 years with respect to its discovery date.
In 1993, a rotational light-curve which was later proven incorrect, was obtained from photometric observations at the Félix Aguilar Observatory, Argentina. It gave an unusual light-curve, indicating a very irregular shape and/or a relatively long rotation period of 22 hours with an exceptionally high amplitude of 1.5 in magnitude (U=0). In August and September 2007, two new light-curves were obtained by Italian astronomer Silvano Casulli and by members at the U.S.Oakley Observatory, and gave a period of 7000584800000000000♠5.848±0.001 and 7000585000000000000♠5.85±0.05 hours, with a brightness variation of 0.50 and of 0.40 in magnitude, respectively (U=3/2+).
According to the space-based surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of the WISE telescope, the asteroid has an albedo of 0.19 and 0.14, with a diameter of 20.6 and 23.9 kilometers, respectively. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a much lower albedo of 0.10 and calculates a diameter of 24.2 kilometer, as the lower the albedo (reflectivety), the larger a body's diameter, at a constant absolute magnitude (brightness).
The minor planet was named in honor of Elena ("Lena") Petrovna Neujmina (1860–1942), mother of the discovering astronomer.
