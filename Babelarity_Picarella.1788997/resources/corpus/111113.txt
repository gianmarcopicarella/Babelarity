Kouřim (Czech pronunciation: [ˈkou̯r̝ɪm]) is a small town in the Central Bohemian Region, Czech Republic. It is located 45 km east of Prague and has a population of 1,769 (2005).
From the 13th to the 16th century, Kourim was one of the most important towns in Bohemia, but later it experienced a decline and a long stagnation. As a result, Kouřim has retained its antique look, for which it is now sought out by tourists and film-makers alike.
