1823 Gliese, provisional designation 1951 RD, is a stony Flora asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 9 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at Heidelberg Observatory in southern Germany on 4 September 1951.
The S-type asteroid is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.9–2.5 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,213 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.14 and an inclination of 3° with respect to the ecliptic. The first used precovery was taken at the discovering observatory in 1950, extending the asteroid's observation arc by one year prior to its discovery. However, the first unused observations date back to 1944 at Johannesburg Observatory.
A rotational light-curve of this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations made by Czech astronomer Petr Pravec at the Ondřejov Observatory in August 2014. The light-curve gave a well-defined rotation period of 7000448640000000000♠4.4864±0.0006 hours with a brightness variation of 0.27 in magnitude (U=3). One month later, in September 2014, a second light-curve by American astronomer Brian Warner at the U.S. Palmer Divide Observatory, Colorado, gave a concurring period of 7000448800000000000♠4.488±0.003 hours with an amplitude of 0.23 in magnitude (U=3).
According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's space-based Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 9.5 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.13, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.24 – derived from 8 Flora, the largest member and namesake of this asteroid's orbital family – and calculates a diameter of 8.2 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 12.6.
The asteroid was named after German astronomer Wilhelm Gliese (1915–1993) at the Astronomisches Rechen-Institut. Gliese is widely known for having compiled about 1,000 stars located within 25 parsecs of Earth into the Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars. Naming citation was published before November 1977 (M.P.C. 4156). A large number of Exoplanets derive their names form this star catalogue.
