Guglielmo Gabetto (24 February 1916 – 4 May 1949) was an Italian footballer who played as a striker.
Aside from goalkeeper Alfredo Bodoira, he is the only player to win the Italian championship with both Torino F.C. and cross-city rivals Juventus F.C..
Gabetto was born in Turin, Italy, in the Aurora district of the Piedmont capital.
He died in a commercial airplane tragedy as one of the victims of the 1949 Superga air disaster, when a plane carrying almost the entire Torino Football Club squad crashed into the Superga hill near Turin. He was buried in the monumental cemetery in Turin.
Gabetto began his career with Juventus in 1934, scoring 102 goals for the club in seven seasons, 85 of which came in the league; he is still today one of the club's best goalscorers.
In 1941 he was acquired by local rivals Torino, for a notable sum of 330,000 Lit.; the same season, Torino bought two other Juventus players: Felice Borel, and Alfredo Bodoira. He formed a notable attack alongside Ezio Loik and Valentino Mazzola, becoming a key player in the Grande Torino side which dominated Italy, winning five consecutive Serie A titles. Interestingly enough, only he and his team-mate Piero Operto were originally from Turin. In total, he scored 127 goals for Torino in 225 matches.
Gabetto also made 6 appearances for Italy between 1942 and 1948, scoring 5 goals, the first of which came on his debut against Croatia on 5 April.
Regarded as one of the best Italian players of his generation, and one of Italy's greatest ever strikers, Gabetto was a complete, creative, fast, and technically gifted forward. He possessed “acrobatic” characteristics that apparently allowed him to make "near-impossible" goals. The precision and the power of his kicking made him an impeccable and highly prolific goal-scorer, which made him an idol of the fans, who affectionately called him "Gabe".
