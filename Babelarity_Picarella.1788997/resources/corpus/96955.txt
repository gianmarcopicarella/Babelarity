Subway Surfers is an "endless running" mobile game co-developed by Kiloo, a private company based in Denmark and SYBO Games. It is available on Android, iOS, Kindle, and Windows Phone platforms. Players of the game take the role of teenage hooligans who, upon being caught in the act of applying graffiti to (tagging) a metro railway site, run down the tracks to escape the Inspector and his dog. As the hooligans run, they grab gold coins out of the air while simultaneously dodging collisions with railway cars and other objects. Special objects, such as the Weekly Hunt, can result an award in the game. Subway Surfers was released on 24 May 2012 with updates based on seasonal holidays. Since 2 January 2013, updates have been based on a "World Tour" which places the game in a new city every month. The Windows Phone 8 version was discontinued in March 2016, due to the development and the release of Windows 10 Mobile version a few months later.
The objective of the game is to collect coins and other rewards while running through an endless game world. Trains and other obstacles must be avoided by performing well-timed jumps (swipe up), rolls (swipe down) and sideways moves (swipe left and right). Occasionally the characters surf on hoverboards, soar over the train tracks and even run along overhead wires. Special missions reward players with bonuses for accomplishing specific tasks. The game ends when the surfer either stumbles and is apprehended or crashes directly into various obstacles.
Subway Surfers allows you to use many power-ups provided in this game. These include jetpacks, super jumpers, super sneakers, coin magnets and score multipliers.
Jake is the default Subway Surfers character and the mascot of Kiloo. Jake appears in game icons. All other characters must be "unlocked." This is done in one of two ways. Some characters are unlocked via the collection of character attributes in the course of the game. An attribute may be an article of clothing (such as a hat) or a prop (such as a stereo). Other characters are available by spending coins in-game.
The Inspector and his Dog chase the characters. While they are always the same character, his uniform changes according to the location. During the New Orleans edition, the Inspector was replaced by Frankenstein with a skeleton dog. During the second London edition, he was dressed as Santa Claus. During the second Rome edition and third Paris, edition he was dressed as the Easter Bunny. During the Prague edition, he was dressed as the Knight.
