At the 1932 Winter Olympics, four speed skating events were contested. For the only time in the Olympic history, the speed skating were held as packstyle events, having all competitors skate at the same time. This competition form was not common in Europe and gave the runners from the United States and Canada a major advantage over the European rivals. Only two medals went to Europeans. Women were allowed to compete but only as part of demonstration sport events. The distances for women were 500 m, 1000 m and 1500 m. The packstyle racing would pave the way for short track speed skating, that would debut as a demonstration event at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary before becoming an official Olympic event at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville.
The men's competitions were held on Thursday, February 4, 1932, Friday, February 5, 1932, Saturday, February 6, 1932, and on Monday, February 8, 1932. The women's events were contested from Monday, February 8, 1932 to Wednesday, February 10, 1932.
Speed skating events for women were demonstration events at the 1932 Games, so no official medals were awarded. Two nations, the USA and Canada, with 10 competitors entered the competition. Like the men's races that used the mass start racing in heats compared to racing in pairs in Europe, the women's races were as well. The official results only show the winning time for each event.
Eight speed skaters competed in all four events.
A total of 31 male speed skaters from six nations competed at the Lake Placid Games:
 Canada (7)
 Finland (1)
 Japan (4)
 Norway (6)
 Sweden (1)
 United States (12)
In addition, ten female speed skaters (five from the United States as well as five from Canada) competed in the women's demonstration events.
Only men's events counted.
