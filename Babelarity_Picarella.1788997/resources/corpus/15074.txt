Rafael Nadal was the defending champion, and successfully defended his title in the final 1–6, 6–1, 6–4, 7–6(7–4), against Roger Federer.
Roger Federer had the chance to become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold all four Grand Slam tournaments at once, having won the preceding Wimbledon, U.S. Open and Australian Open titles. He lost in the final against Rafael Nadal.
This tournament is also noted for the first appearance of future Grand Slam champion Juan Martin Del Potro in a Grand Slam main draw, and also the first time that future World No. 1 Novak Djokovic reached the quarterfinals of the Grand Slam.
