At the 1904 Summer Olympics of Saint Louis, Missouri, eleven gymnastics events were contested, all for men only.
The 1904 Games had a confusing program of events spread out over several months, and the gymnastics competition was no different. The International Olympic Committee considers two sets of events as "Olympic":
International Turners' Championship held July 1â€“2, comprising the all-around, triathlon, and team events
Olympic Gymnastics Championships held October 29, comprising the seven individual apparatus events and the combined event.
The individual all-around was a combination of the gymnastic triathlon competition and the athletics triathlon. The team competition was a combination of individual scores from the individual all-around.
The parallel bars, horizontal bar, vault, and pommel horse scores for each gymnast were summed to get the "combined" score.
119 gymnasts from 3 nations competed.
 Germany (7)
 Switzerland (1)
 United States (111)
