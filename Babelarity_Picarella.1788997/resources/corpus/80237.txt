Cutlass is a short drama film which was filmed in 2007, written and directed by Kate Hudson.
Lacy (Dakota Fanning), a young songwriter, discovers a great but expensive guitar in a music shop. She's very excited by the guitar, and asks her mother, Robin (Virginia Madsen), to buy it. However, her mom says "absolutely not", but after that she reminiscences about the time back in 1979 when she got an Olds Cutlass as her first car. Her father used to say: "Whatever makes you happy, makes me happy". Maybe... in the end... she'll change her mind about Lacy's wish.
