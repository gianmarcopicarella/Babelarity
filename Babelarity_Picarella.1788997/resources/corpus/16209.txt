The 2014 Wimbledon Championships was a tennis tournament which took place at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in Wimbledon, London, United Kingdom, from 23 June to 6 July 2014. They were the 128th edition of the championships, the 47th in the Open Era and the third Grand Slam tournament of the year, played on grass courts and part of the ATP World Tour, the WTA Tour, the ITF Junior Tour and the NEC Tour. They were organised by the All England Lawn Tennis Club and the International Tennis Federation.
Andy Murray of Great Britain was the defending champion in men's singles, but lost to Grigor Dimitrov in the quarter-finals. Marion Bartoli of France was the defending champion in women's singles; however, her retirement from the sport following her victory meant that she did not return to defend her title. As a result, the opening Ladies' Singles match on Centre Court on the second day of the tournament – which is traditionally played by the defending champion – was played by Bartoli's opponent, runner-up Sabine Lisicki.
The men and women's singles titles were won by Novak Djokovic of Serbia and Petra Kvitová of the Czech Republic respectively. Both players had previously won their maiden – and, prior to 2014, only – Wimbledon title in 2011.
