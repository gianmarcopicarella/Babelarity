New Eskişehir Stadium will be a multi-use stadium in [Sazova district of (West) Eskişehir, Turkey. The stadium will have a capacity of nearly 33,500 people (all-seated) and will be totally covered. It would be also one of the 9 candidate host stadiums of Turkish bid for EURO 2016. But Turkey has lost the election of the CUP. Despite this result, the Chairman of TFF said "we have to work on these stadiums like a winner of the election, I'm going to talk about it with Primeminister". According to this explanation, Turkey is going to bid for the next tournament as a host country as well and the projects will be constructed due to its schedule.
The New Eskişehir Stadium will be the centrepiece for the development of a new sports, business and university park, planned by the City of Eskişehir at the northern periphery of the town. Eskişehir is famous for Sepiolite (Meerschaum) mining which has left a distinct signature on the landscape and inspires the façade of the stadium. The inner walls will be constructed partially with serigraphic glass to provide maximum transparency from the inside and to emphasise its open character at night. A newly planned tram will connect the New Eskişehir Stadium with the city centre, the airport and the university. This new public transport will accelerate the development of the new sports, leisure and business area. A new express ringroad around the city will also pass just south of the stadium providing excellent access.
