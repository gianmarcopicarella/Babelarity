Halluin (French pronunciation: ​[alɥɛ̃]; Dutch: Halewijn) is a commune in the Nord department in northern France.
It is located at the north of the Lille Urban Community, on the Belgian border, contiguous with the Belgian town of Menen.
The line was formerly served by the Somain-Halluin Railway.
The A22 autoroute links the town to Lille and Belgium.
An erstwhile bastion of the left, Halluin owes its nickname Halluin the Red to the powerful trade unions who used their influence to support communist mayors during the interbellum. However, since the 1990s Halluin has become gentrified, and in the 2007 and 2012 presidential elections the town backed Nicolas Sarkozy.
In 2014 mayoral elections, voters chose the right wing parties by a solid margin of 62% :Gustave Dassonville (UMP) received 40% of the votes and Jean-Christophe Destailleur (Centre-right) received 22% of the votes.
Left wing parties with 38% of votes have been defeated, and Gustave Dassonville has been elected mayor of this town.
