Andriscus (Ancient Greek: Ἀνδρίσκος, Andrískos), also often referenced as Pseudo-Philip, was the last King of Macedon (r. 149–148 BC). A pretender who claimed to be the son of Perseus of Macedon. In actually, he was a fuller from Adramyttium in Aeolis in western Anatolia. His reign lasted just a year.
In 168 BC, the Romans invaded Macedonia and overthrew king Perseus in the First Battle of Pydna.
In 149 BC, Andriskos, claiming to be Perseus' son, announced his intention to retake Macedonia from the Romans.
As his first attempt, Andriskos travelled to Syria to request military help from Demetrius Soter of Syria. Demetrius instead handed him over to the Romans but Andriskos managed to escaped from Roman captivity, and raised a Thracian army. With this army, he invaded Macedonia and defeated the Roman praetor Publius Juventius in 149 BC. Andriskos then declared himself King Philip VI of Macedonia.
In 148 BC, Andriskos conquered Thessaly and made an alliance with Carthage, thus bringing the Roman wrath on him. In 148 BC, in what the Romans called the Fourth Macedonian War, he was defeated by the Roman praetor Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus at the Second Battle of Pydna, and fled to Thrace, whose prince gave him up to Rome, thus marking the final end to Andriskos' reign of Macedonia.
Andriscus' brief reign over Macedonia was marked by cruelty and extortion. After this Macedonia was formally reduced to a Roman province.
