The 1992 German Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Hockenheimring in Hockenheim, Germany on 26 July 1992. The 45-lap race was the tenth round of the 1992 Formula One season and was won by Williams driver (and polesitter) Nigel Mansell. Ayrton Senna finished the race in second place for the McLaren team whilst Michael Schumacher took the final podium spot in his Benetton.
The Ostkurve chicane was modified for this race from a quick left-right gap into a turning sequence, there were safety concerns with the chicane the year previous when Ã‰rik Comas had a major accident there in his Ligier.
In pre-qualifying, both Moda cars went out, although Perry McCarthy was excluded from the event after missing a weighbridge check.
Nigel Mansell qualified on pole position, ahead of Riccardo Patrese and Ayrton Senna. Stefano Modena, Eric van de Poele, Andrea Chiesa and Damon Hill were the four drivers who didn't qualify for the race. For Chiesa, it would prove to be the last time he took part in a Grand Prix event, as he was replaced for the next race at the Fondmetal team by van de Poele.
On the last lap, Riccardo Patrese spun off whilst trying to pass Ayrton Senna for second position. He would end up being classified in eighth position. Mansell held on for the race victory, ahead of Senna in second, whose McLaren car ran out of fuel shortly after crossing the finish line and Michael Schumacher in third.
Ayrton Senna dropped out of title contention at this race, although it seemed inevitable that only Mansell would be Driver's Champion anyway - he clinched the title at the next race in Hungary.
