Reckoning Night is the fourth full-length studio album by the Finnish power metal band Sonata Arctica, as well as the first to feature keyboardist Henrik Klingenberg.
All songs written and composed by Tony Kakko, except for "My Selene" by Jani Liimatainen. 
The hidden track "Jam" is on all albums, but is often mistaken for the Japanese/Korean-only bonus track "Wrecking the Sphere". "Jam" is a jammed Flamenco-style tune (as the name implies) and is significantly shorter than "Wrecking the Sphere", which is a typical song.
Also released as limited and numbered seabag (1,000 copies, available only per Nuclear Blast mailorder) with digipack CD, T-Shirt and gimmicks.
