The women's doubles tennis competition at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing was held from 10 August to 17 August at the Olympic Green Tennis Centre. The DecoTurf surface rendered the event a hardcourt tournament.
The results returned the gold to the United States, after the only Olympiad at which they had not won the gold medal since the event's re-introduction in 1988. It was also the second occasion on which the team of Serena and Venus Williams emerged as Olympic champions, having previously captured the gold in Sydney. Spanish Olympian Virginia Ruano Pascual successfully defended her silver medal from Athens, albeit with a different partner. Although China failed to repeat its historic championship performance from Athens, it did return to the medal stand for a bronze. Russia, whose doubles teams were composed of individuals who had won all the medals in this Olympiad's singles event, failed to advance past the quarterfinals.
