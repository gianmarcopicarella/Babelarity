The Sony Ericsson Xperia arc S (Xperia LT18i) is a high-end smartphone developed by Sony Ericsson running Google's operating system Android 2.3.4 (Gingerbread). It is an upgrade of the Xperia Arc. It is the last phone carrying the Sony Ericsson brand, before Sony bought Ericsson's stake in the joint-venture.
Released in October 2011. The device's primary improvements over its predecessor are a 1.4 GHz Scorpion Snapdragon CPU and 14.4Mbit/s HSDPA, compared to the same model at 1.0 GHz and 7.2Mbit/s HSDPA in the Arc. Aside from the CPU speed upgrade and HSDPA speed upgrade, additional hardware remains unchanged.
On 26 July 2012, Sony Mobile Communications officially confirmed via their Facebook page that the Xperia arc S along with the Xperia Mini Pro would not be receiving the Android 4.1 Jelly Bean update. However, this statement was then retracted and Sony has issued a new statement stating they are investigating the possibility of software upgrades for the two devices. However, as of December 2015, the upgrade has not materialised.
The Arc S features a capacitive touchscreen display of 4.2 inches and is equipped with an 8.1-megapixel camera with Exmor R for low-light capture. The camera supports 720p high definition video.
The device ships with an 8 GB microSD card for user storage and is expandable up to 32 GB (SDHC) or 64 GB (SDXC).
It comes in several colours: "Pure White", "Midnight Blue", "Misty Silver", "Gloss Black", "Sakura Pink".
