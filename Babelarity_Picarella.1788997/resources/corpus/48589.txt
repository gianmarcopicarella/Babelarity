The emblem of Kyrgyzstan was adopted following the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 4 January 1994. The emblem has a circular form which mostly bears the color blue. Light blue is known as the Kyrgyz color of courage and generosity (c.f. the flag of Kazakhstan and the emblem of Kazakhstan). To the left and right of the coat of arms, wheat and cotton are displayed. In the upper part, the name of the country appears in Kyrgyz "Кыргыз Республикасы" (Kyrgyz Respublikasy).
In the middle, the Tian Shan mountains are displayed, below which fields are shown. Behind the mountain panorama, one sees a rising sun. A hawk beating its wings stands under this panorama, which gives the impression that the panorama lies on the shoulders of the hawk.
Before independence from the USSR, Kyrgyzstan had a coat of arms similar to all other Soviet Republics. Like other post-Soviet republics whose arms do not predate the October Revolution, the current emblem retains some components of the Soviet one, in this case, the wheat, cotton, rising sun and the Tien Shan.
