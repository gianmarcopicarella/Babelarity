Rodríguez was selected with the 27th pick in the first round, by the Phoenix Suns, in the 2006 NBA draft (and later that day traded to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for cash considerations). On July 20, 2006, it was announced that the Trail Blazers had negotiated a buyout with his Spanish League club Estudiantes, and signed him to an NBA rookie-scale contract.
On June 25, 2009, Rodríguez was traded, along with the 38th pick in the 2009 NBA draft, and cash considerations, to the Sacramento Kings for the 31st pick in the 2009 NBA draft.
On February 18, 2010, Rodríguez was traded to the New York Knicks, along with Tracy McGrady, in a 3-team trade deal.
On July 5, 2010, after spending four seasons in the NBA, Rodríguez signed a 3-year contract with the Spanish team Real Madrid. In July 2012, he signed a 2-year contract extension with Real Madrid, extending his contract through the 2014–15 season.
On January 9, 2014, he signed an extension with Real Madrid, staying in the club until 2018. In May 2014, alongside his teammate Rudy Fernández, he was named to the All-Euroleague First Team of the Euroleague. Prior the Final 4, he has been named the Euroleague MVP of the season, averaging 14 points, 4.9 assists and 2 rebounds over 31 games, despite not starting in any game.
In 2014–15 season, Real Madrid won the Euroleague, after defeating Olympiacos with 78–59 in the final game. Real Madrid eventually finished the season winning the Spanish League championship, after 3–0 score in the final series against Barcelona. With that trophy, they have won the triple crown.
On 13 July 2016, Rodríguez signed with the Philadelphia 76ers.
Thought to be one of the best European prospects of his age, Rodríguez was named the MVP of the 2004 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship, which was held in Zaragoza, Spain, while playing with the Spanish national junior team. He led the host Spanish team to the tournament's gold medal. In the eight games of that tournament, he averaged 19 points per game, 4.6 rebounds per game, 8.5 assists per game, and 2.1 steals per game.
