Umeshu (梅酒) is a Japanese liqueur made from steeping ume fruits (while still unripe and green) in alcohol (焼酎, shōchū) and sugar. It has a sweet, sour taste, and an alcohol content of 10–15%. The taste and aroma of umeshu can appeal to even those people who normally dislike alcohol. Famous brands of umeshu include Choya and Takara Shuzo. Varieties are available with whole ume fruits contained in the bottle, and some make their own umeshu at home.
Japanese restaurants serve many different varieties of umeshu and also make cocktails. Umeshu on the Rocks (pronounced umeshu rokku), Umeshu Sour (pronounced umeshu sawa), Umeshu Tonic (with 2/3 tonic water), Umeshu Soda (with 2/3 carbonated water) and the Flaming Plum cocktail are popular. It is sometimes mixed with green tea (o-cha-wari) or warm water (o-yu-wari). "Umeshu" can be served at different temperatures; chilled or with ice, room temperature, or even hot in the winter.
