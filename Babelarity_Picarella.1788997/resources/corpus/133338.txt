The Hungarian Catholic Church (Hungarian: Magyar Katolikus Egyház) is part of the worldwide Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the Pope in Rome.
There are around 3.842 million Catholics in Hungary — or 39% of the population (2011 census). The country is divided into 12 dioceses including 4 archdioceses. In addition, there is a territorial abbey and a separate sui juris particular Church for those who adhere to the Byzantine Rite known as the Hungarian Greek Catholic Church.
The Church has been in decline in recent decades in Hungary; although the decline has not been as dramatic as in the Czech Republic, it is nowadays only a plurality in the country.
