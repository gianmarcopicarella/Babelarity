Nooksack (/ˈnʊksæk/ US dict: nŏŏk′·săk) is a city in Whatcom County, Washington, close to the border with Canada. The population was 1,338 at the 2010 census. This town shares Nooksack Valley School District with Sumas and Everson.
The town is just a handful of buildings built around the highway that runs through it. The post office lost its official status in 1992 (and is now a department of neighboring town, Everson), but still exists across from a small city park. The USPS has since closed the remote office. Other noticeable remains are the two gas stations and several churches. It has no major geographic features except a small creek on the edge of town, near a cemetery containing many old graves.
Nooksack contracts their Police and sewer services through the nearby City of Everson.
Nooksack was officially incorporated on December 6, 1912, and experienced much growth in its early years. It had a rail station, connecting it to the national train network. However, serious fires in the town in the early twentieth century caused most of the growth to halt.
Darius and Tabitha Kinsey, notable early twentieth century photographers, are buried in Nooksack. They specialised in documentary photographs as social commentaries and also images of early logging, fishing and railroad operations.
