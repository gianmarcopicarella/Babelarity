Caprese salad (Italian: Insalata Caprese [insaˈlaːta kaˈpreːze], meaning "Salad of Capri") is a simple Italian salad, made of sliced fresh mozzarella (ideally Buffalo mozzarella), tomatoes, and green basil, seasoned with salt and olive oil. It is made to resemble the colors of the Italian flag: red, white, and green. In Italy, it is usually served as an antipasto (starter), not a contorno (side dish).
While insalate Caprese is traditionally seasoned with olive oil and oregano, there are variations seasoned with pesto and other sauces, like Italian dressing. Some variations substitute basil with rucola. In further variations other non-traditional ingredients, like chopped garlic, parsley, olives, or romaine lettuce, are also added.
