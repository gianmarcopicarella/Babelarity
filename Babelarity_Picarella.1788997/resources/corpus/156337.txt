San Augustine County is a county located in the U.S. state of Texas. As of the 2010 census, its population was 8,865. Its county seat is San Augustine.
San Augustine County was formed in 1837. It was supposedly named after the Saint, Augustine of Hippo. However, it seems plausible that the county was named for the town of San Augustine, which had been established five years earlier and whose name was based upon an 18th-century Spanish presidio (fortress).
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 592 square miles (1,530 km2), of which 531 square miles (1,380 km2) is land and 62 square miles (160 km2) (10%) is water.
