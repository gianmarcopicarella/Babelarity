High School Musical 2 is the soundtrack album for the Disney Channel Original Movie of the same name.
Debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, Amazon.com, and iTunes Store, the album sold 615,000 copies in its initial week of release. As of September 2007, this figure amounted to the fourth-biggest first week sales of the year. It was the first soundtrack of a television movie to debut at the Billboard summit. The album also shipped double platinum (2,000,000) copies in the U.S. in its first week of release. It was the best-selling album of 2007, with sales of over 2.96 million copies in the United States and 6 million copies worldwide. The album won Favorite Soundtrack Album at The American Music Awards of 2007.
The Wal-Mart Exclusive of the album was released on August 14, 2007, and contained the original soundtrack (albeit in a slightly different order) and an extra DVD, which seemingly contains most (if not all) episodes of "Road to High School Musical". The 2-disc Collector's edition version of the album released in Singapore on December 3, 2007.
The album was the number-one most downloaded album on iTunes and Amazon.com on its first day of release, and remained so a week later.
The album debuted at #1 on the U.S. Billboard 200 with sales of 615,000 copies, the fourth best first-week sales of 2007 (trailing behind Linkin Park's Minutes to Midnight, 50 Cent's Curtis, and Kanye West's Graduation). The set also claimed the biggest first-week sales for a television soundtrack. It remained at number-one in its second, third, and fourth weeks, selling 367,000 copies in its second, 210,000 copies in its third, and 165,000 copies in its fourth. The soundtrack is the first album in over two years to spend four consecutive weeks at #1 on the Billboard 200.
After spending four consecutive weeks at number one on the Billboard 200, the album dropped to number four, following the releases of Kanye West's Graduation, 50 Cent's Curtis, and Kenny Chesney's Just Who I Am: Poets & Pirates, respectively. In its fifteenth week on the Billboard 200, during November 2007, High School Musical 2 returned to the top 10 with a 130% sales increase (183,000 copies), bringing it to #6 and making it 2007's best-selling album, ahead of Daughtry. However, Daughtry held onto the spot, becoming 2007's biggest selling album. To date, it has sold 3.4 million copies in the US.
