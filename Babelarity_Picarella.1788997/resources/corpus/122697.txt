The Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua (Valencian pronunciation: [akaˈðɛmia valensiˈana ðe la ˈʎeŋɡwa], English: Valencian Language Academy), also known by the acronym AVL, is an institution created on September 16, 1998 by the Valencian Parliament, which belongs to the set of official institutions that compose the Generalitat Valenciana, according to the Act of Autonomy of the Valencian Community.
Its primary function is to determine and set the official standards for the Valencian language as used in the Valencian Community (known in other territories as Catalan), and foster its use. According to its foundational law, the AVL linguistic regulations for Valencian must follow current Valencian genuine linguistic reality, respect Valencian lexicographic and literary tradition and start from the consolidated regulations based upon the Normes de Castelló, a set of orthographic rules for Valencian signed in 1932.
The headquarters of the Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua are in Valencia city.
