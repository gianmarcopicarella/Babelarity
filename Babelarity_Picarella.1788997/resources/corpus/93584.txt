Collocalia is a genus of swifts, containing some of the smaller species termed "swiftlets". Formerly a catch-all genus for these, a number of its erstwhile members are now normally (though not by all authors) placed in Aerodramus.
Remaining in Collocalia are:
Glossy swiftlet, Collocalia esculenta
Grey-rumped swiftlet, Collocalia (esculenta) marginata
Christmas swiftlet, Collocalia (esculenta) natalis
Cave swiftlet, Collocalia linchi
Bornean swiftlet, Collocalia dodgei
Pygmy swiftlet, Collocalia troglodytes
An Early Miocene fossil swiftlet from the famous Riversleigh deposits of Australia was described as Collocalia buday. This as well as a right ulna (MNZ S42799) found at the Manuherikia River in Otago, New Zealand and dating from the Early to Middle Miocene (Awamoan to Lillburnian, 19-16 million years ago) would probably go into Aerodramus too.
