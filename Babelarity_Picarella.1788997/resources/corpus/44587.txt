Terrence "Terry" Williams (born 11 January 1948 in Swansea, Wales) is a retired Welsh rock drummer, whose resume includes work for Dire Straits and Man.
During the 1960s, Williams played in a number of Welsh bands, including Commancheros, The Smokeless Zone, Dream and Plum Crazy, before joining Dave Edmunds' band Love Sculpture. In 1970 he joined the Welsh rock group Man, which included two former Dream and Smokeless Zone members, Deke Leonard and Martin Ace. With Man, he originally appeared on 7 Studio albums, 3 Live albums and 2 Various artists, live albums, and has subsequently appeared on a number of retrospective releases. When Man split in 1976, Williams re-joined Edmunds in the band Rockpile with Nick Lowe and Billy Bremner, and continued working with Leonard.
Between 1981 and 1982, he was part of the Neverland Express band, backing Meat Loaf, then in 1982 he joined Dire Straits, with whom he played until 1988 (a period that included their live album Alchemy: Dire Straits Live and Brothers in Arms). In 1996, he briefly rejoined Man, after John Weathers left, but left the following year.
Williams ran a blues club in Swansea from 2000 until 2007.
