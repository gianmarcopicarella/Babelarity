In Greek mythology, an Oread /ˈɔːriˌæd/ or /ˈɔːri.əd/ (Ancient Greek: Ὀρεάδες, Oreades, from ὄρος, "mountain") or Orestiad /ɔːˈrɛstiˌæd/ or /ɔːˈrɛsti.əd/ (Όρεστιάδες, Orestiades) was a type of nymph that lived in mountains, valleys, and ravines. They differ from each other according to their dwelling: the Idaeae were from Mount Ida, Peliades from Mount Pelion, etc. They were associated with Artemis, since the goddess, when she went out hunting, preferred mountains and rocky precipices.
