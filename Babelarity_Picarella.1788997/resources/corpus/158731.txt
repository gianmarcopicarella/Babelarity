Agartala /əɡərtəˈlɑː/ (Bengali: আগরতলা Agortola) is the capital as well as the largest city of the Indian state of Tripura and also is the second largest city in North-east India after Guwahati, both in municipal area and population. The city is the seat of the Government of Tripura. Agartala is one of the fastest developing cities of India.
Agartala is a component of two words, namely "Agar", a kind of oily valuable perfume tree, + suffix "tala", a store house. The city is governed by the Agartala Municipal Corporation. Agartala lies on the bank of the Haora River and is located 2 km from the Bangladesh Border. Agartala is India's third international internet gateway after the ones in Mumbai and Chennai.

The percentage of literacy according to 2011 census was 93.88, higher than the national literacy rate. As per Municipal Census of 2015, the population of Agartala is 522,613.
Perched on the banks of River Howrah, the low-key capital city of Tripura-Agartala- entices the excursionists and sightseers with its past splendor. As the name Agartala derived from the words Agar and tala consisting of heavy density of Agaru tree, Agar was referred in the context of great king Raghu who tied up his Elephant feet with Agar tree on the banks of Lauhitya. One of the earliest kings of Agartala was Patardan B.C. 1900 it was the time long before the Manikya Dynasties. Chitrarath, Drikpati, Dharmapha, Loknath Jivandharan were the important king during the time of B.C. in Agartala.
From the mythological, epigraphic and archaeological evidences excavated by the historians, it is clear that the glory of Tripura is a long-flourishing one. With early references in epic texts like the Mahabharata, the legacy and historical importance of this quaint city can be easily gauged. In the past, Tripura served as the capital to several noted Hindu kingdoms. Although a clear chronology of the rulers is not available, records reveal that the land has been ruled by as many as 179 Hindu rulers, starting from mythological King Druhya to the last king of Tripura, Kirit Bikram Kishore Manikya. Apart from the great Hindu rule, Tripura also witnessed the glorious rule of the Mughals. However, with the rise of British power in India, the state came under the governance of English in 1808. Much later the ancient capital of the then Princely State 'Swadhin Tripura' was at Rangamati (Udaipur, South Tripura) by the bank of the river Gomati. In 1760 it was shifted by the Maharaja Krishna Chandra Manikya Bahadur (r.1829–1849) of Manikya Dynasty to present old Agartala by the bank of the river Haora/Saidra and was named 'Haveli'. Due to frequent invasion of the Kuki's and also to keep easy communication with the British Bengal, the Maharaja Krishna Chandra Manikya started the process of shifting the capital from Old Haveli to New Haveli (present Agartala) in 1849. During the British Raj, Agartala was the capital of the erstwhile 'Hill Tippera' state, it became a municipality in 1874–75, and in 1901 had the population of 9,513. The princely state always remained as cake piece to the British and many other invaders, such happened when the Arakhan soldiers did really attacked in the old capital of the state following which the king of Tripura responded them in a tricky way by defeating the entire troop. With the waves of Indian Independence, the people of Tripura started Ganamukti Parishad movement to include the state as the kingdom of India. The then queen of Tripura Maharani Kanchanprava Devi signed the agreement on 15 October 1949 permitting the government to merge the province with independent India. On 1 July 1963, Tripura became a centrally administered Union Territory and attained the status of full-fledged state on 21 January 1972. Agartala was named as the capital of Tripura. The Agartala Municipality was established during the reign of Maharaja Bir Chandra Manikya (1862–1896) within an area of 3 square miles (8 km2) having a population of only 875 by a royal proclamation in the last part of 1871. Mr. A.W.S. Power, the first British political agent for Tipperah was also appointed as the Chairman of the Agartala Municipality in 1872 who held office from 1872–73. The municipality located at the crossing of Latitude N 23 –50' and Longitude E 91-17' covering 3 km2. Area during that period.
Maharaja Bir Bikram Kishore Manikya Bahadur is called the founder of the planned city of Agartala. He had gone for a tour in the United Kingdom and after returning to his kingdom he decided that he would make Agartala a mini UK that was During the 1940s when the town area was re-organised in a planned manner with new roads and a market building making a good comfort for the people.
The population of Agartala was 367,822 in 2004 after the municipal expansion (189,327 in the 2001 census).
From 1901 to 1971 the city remained in a negligible development progress with only an 8 km2 or area but from 1981 Agartala started to expand and increase its connectivity in various fields along with its city area with 58.84 km2, greater Agartala is planned as of 2011 with an additional of 92 km2. Agartala had a different type of history from the earlier times of the epic days as it was a princely state and was connected with Bangladesh once upon a time. Though the East India Company has not arrived in this princely capital of the state but they always remained in a certain in capturing and ruling. The East India Company had set their base of North East India in the Assam province with Shillong as their capital.

On 1 November 1956, Tripura became a Union Territory and an Advisory Committee was formed to advise the Chief Commissioner. On 15 August 1957, a Territorial Council was formed with 30 elected members and two members nominated by the Government of India. On 1 July 1963, the Tripura Territorial Council was dissolved and a Legislative Assembly with the existing members of the Territorial Council was formed. Tripura is governed through a parliamentary system of representative democracy, a feature it shares with other Indian states. Universal suffrage is granted to residents. The Tripura government has three branches: executive, legislature and judiciary. The Tripura Legislative Assembly consists of elected members and special office bearers that are elected by the members. Assembly meetings are presided over by the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker in case of Speaker's absence. The Assembly is unicameral with 60 Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). Agartala assembly constituency is part of Tripura West. Agartala has always been in a ripen fruit to all the political parties and as a result clashes between Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Indian National Congress has always been a common thing to see. After the independence of India in 1947 Tripura was still a princely state. After death of the last king Maharaja Bir Bikram Kishore Manikya on 17 May 1947, a Regency Council was formed headed by Maharani Kanchan Prava Devi, for aid of the minor Prince, Kirit Bikram Kishore Manikya Bahadur. The regent signed the merger agreement with the Government of India. After merger Tripura became a Part 'C' State. On reorganisation of the states, effected in November 1956, Tripura became a Union Territory with an Advisory Committee to aid and advise the Chief Commissioner. Tripura gained its state hood on 21 January 1972 before that but merging with India in 1949 the first chief minister of the state was on 1 July 1963, Sachindra Lal Singh of the Indian National Congress, he was the CM of the state for around 3046 days. From 5 January 1978 the rule of the congress came to an end as Nripen Chakraborty became the first Communist chief minister of Tripura. Later again the communist fell and the INC rose and was in power till 1992, from 1993 again CPI(M) came to power and is continuing till now. Manik Sarkar is the current CM of the state from 11 March 1998 Agartala is administered by several government agencies. The Agartala Municipal Council, or AMC, oversees and manages the civic infrastructure of the city which together encompass 35 wards. Each ward elects a councillor to the AMC. Each borough has a committee of councillors, each of whom is elected to represent a ward. By means of the borough committees, the council undertakes urban planning and maintains roads, government-aided schools, hospitals, and municipal markets.
The city is the state capital. Most of the population is employed in the state and central government, and other government owned enterprises. Since liberalisation in the early nineties the economy of India has seen tremendous growth which was not stalled even by the dot com bubble burst in 2000 and the recession of 2009. But the economy of Agartala has not been developing in tandem with the economy of the country till the year 2000. The development has been quite slow; though lot of consumer brands in telecom and retail have entered Tripura but that would be mainly because the markets in tier 1 and tier 2 cities have saturated and they are looking for new territories to expand their business. Entry of MNCs and the rise of Indian giants have provided the perennially cash starved middle class with higher disposable income, but Agartala seems to have not benefited much from it. There are handful of private companies in the state so majority of the people have govt. So the population with high disposable income is quite low in the state. The young population between the age group of 23–40 are major spendthrifts; they also constitute the major part of the Indian population. NIT, Tripura Medical College, MBB College, Tripura University, [ICFAI UNIVERSITY] etc. are few good and prominent colleges in the state in which students find better than the other colleges in the state, a major chunk again leaves for job in the big metros of India.
We all know that the economy develops when the spending of the population increases, this was the reason behind the booming of American, Japanese or Korean economy. Even the Indian cities like Mohali, Surat, Coimbatore etc. sees high consumer spending and are doing good. The buying pattern of the consumers of Agartala had evolved quite a lot after the expansion of the city and the rise in population; earlier the major buying took place once a year i.e., during Durga puja while the rest of the year buying took place only for occasions like marriage, birthday etc. but nowadays shopping has become a fashion to everyone in Agartala, the opening of the city centre, malls, etc. had increased the demand of purchasing goods to the people here. The buying is decided and the instances of impulse buying are moderately high as compared to the past decades. The retail space of Agartala before was that it didn't encourage much of impulse buying. The shopping malls are major places of hang out for both young and old, lot of people of who go to malls to do window shopping and pass some time end up buying something. The city centre at Agartala is a substitute for a mall, another is the Battala super market which is also one of the main hub of markets of Tripura. Brands like Titan, Titan Eye +, Fastrack, Reebok, John Player, Lee, adidas, Puma, Nike, Levis had opened and are moderately good here. The people of Agartala have high aspiration the reflection of which we can see in the buying pattern of cell phones and two-wheelers. The retail brands have to just educate the consumer about themselves; they have to incentivise them to spend more than the planned shoppings.
