418 Alemannia, provisional designation 1896 CV, is a metallic asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, about 34 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by German astronomer Max Wolf at Heidelberg Observatory in southern Germany, on 7 September 1896.
The M-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.3–2.9 AU once every 4 years and 2 months (1,526 days). Its orbit is tilted by 7 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic and shows an eccentricity of 0.12. Several photometric light-curve observations rendered a rotation period of 4.67 hours, superseding previous observations that gave a period of 5.82 and 4.68 hours, respectively.
According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the body's albedo lies between 0.11 and 0.20, a typical value for moderately bright, metallic M-type asteroids.
The minor planet was named after the student fraternity Alemannia in Heidelberg, Germany. It was named by German astronomer Adolf Berberich (1861–1920), after whom the asteroid 776 Berbericia is named.
