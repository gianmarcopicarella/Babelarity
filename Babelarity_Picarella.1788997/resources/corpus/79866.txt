Disneynature is an independent film unit of Walt Disney Studios that produces nature documentary films. It was founded on April 21, 2008, and is headquartered in Paris, France. Disney veteran Jean-Francois Camilleri, who has served as senior vice president and general manager for Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures France, is the head of the new unit.
The nature films are budgeted between $5 million to $10 million and would be handled by Disney Studio's distribution and marketing. Many of its films are released on Earth Day.
Disney had a background in making nature films from 1948 through 1960 producing the True-Life Adventures series which won several Academy Awards. March of the Penguins came out in 2005 distributed through Warner Independent Pictures on a $8 million budget but gross almost 10 times at the US box office and won an Oscar. Disney CEO Bob Iger considering Disney's past efforts felt that Penguins "should have been a Disney film worldwide".
Environmentally, Disney's Animal Kingdom in Orlando has nursed back to health endangered sea turtles, took white rhinos back to Africa and did a Cotton-top tamarins, a Colombia only monkey species, census. Also since 1995, the Disney Wildlife Conservation Fund has doled out more than $11 million to 650 projects in 110 countries.
Disneynature was announce on April 21, 2008, a day before Earth Day with a starting slate of seven films under Jean-Francois Camilleri. No decision on donating to conservation causes from the proceeds was not made by that time. The first film released domestically under the new label was Earth based on the award-winning BBC and Discovery Channel series "Planet Earth" with a April 22, 2009 opening date.
In 2012, a Disneynature TV pay cable channel was launched in France and is currently carried by France Telecom.
Disneynature expanded to China with the production of Born in China starting in 2014 through an expansion of Disney's relationship with Shanghai Media Group.
