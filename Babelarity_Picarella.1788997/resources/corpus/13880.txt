Aldo Serena (born in Montebelluna on 25 June 1960) is an Italian former footballer, who was usually deployed as a forward. He played for the Azzurri in the 1986 FIFA World Cup and the 1990 FIFA World Cup, where Italy finished in third place. Serena was a strong, dedicated, and athletic forward who excelled in the air, in particular with his head. He was also capable of finishing well with his powerful and accurate left foot.
During his career, Serena played for Montebelluna, Inter, Como, Bari, A.C. Milan, Juventus and Torino. Although he had previously won the 1981–82 Coppa Italia with Inter, he enjoyed his best season with the club during the 1988–89 campaign, when he won the Scudetto with Inter, and was crowned top scorer of the league, scoring 22 goals. He went on to win the 1989 Supercoppa Italiana and the 1990–91 UEFA Cup with Inter. During his time at Inter, he also briefly enjoyed a two-season successful spell with Juventus between 1985 and 1987, scoring 21 Serie A goals in 51 appearances, and winning the 1985 Intercontinental Cup, and the 1985–86 Serie A title.
After his move to local rivals Milan, his reputation as an Inter legend was somewhat tarnished. This was shown recently when Serena's name was booed by some of Inter's Ultras supporters when it was announced that he was to be part of an Inter Legends gathering after the final game of the 2006–07 league trophy presentation. With Milan, he won another 1992 Supercoppa Italiana, and another two Serie A titles, although he was used with less frequency, only making 10 appearances over his two final seasons, and he failed to score in Serie A during his time at the club.
Serena played for the Azzurri in two World Cups, first in the 1986 FIFA World Cup and then in the 1990 FIFA World Cup on home soil, where Italy finished in third place. Serena also played for the Italian under-23 side at the 1984 Summer Olympics. In total he earned 24 caps and scored 5 goals for the senior Italian national team.
In Italia '90 Serena scored with a header on his 30th birthday in Italy's 2–0 win over Uruguay. In the semi-final match, he left the pitch in tears after he missed a crucial spot kick in the semi-final shoot-out against Argentina, with the goalkeeper saving the ball to his left, a game the home nation lost on penalties. Serena has always stated that he did not want to take a penalty in the shootout. However, as no-one else volunteered, Italian manager Azeglio Vicini had no choice but to include Serena as the final penalty kick taker. Italy won the third-place match against England, however, capturing the bronze medal.
