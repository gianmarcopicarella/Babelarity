Phenolic acids or phenolcarboxylic acids are types of aromatic acid compound. Included in that class are substances containing a phenolic ring and an organic carboxylic acid function (C6-C1 skeleton). There are several categories of phenolic acids including:
Monohydroxybenzoic acids: salicylic acid, 3-Hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid
Some esters of this group include paraben, methyl paraben, propyl paraben
Dihydroxybenzoic acids: vanillin, vanillic acid, gentisic acid, protocatechuic acid
Trihydroxybenzoic acids: gallic acid, ellagic acid, syringic acid, eudesmic acid, phloroglucinol carboxylic acid
This type of phenolic acids (especially gallic acid, ellagic acid) is a component of hydrolysable tannins.
Phenolic acids can be found in many plant species. Their content in dried fruits can be high.
Natural phenols in horse grams (Macrotyloma uniflorum) are mostly phenolic acids, namely 3,4-dihydroxy benzoic, p-hydroxy benzoic, vanillic, caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, syringic and sinapinic acids.
Phenolic acids can be found in mushroom Basidiomycetes species. It is also a part of the humic substances, which are the major organic constituents of soil humus.
Many phenolic acids can be found in human urine.
Immobilized Candida antarctica lipase can be used to catalyze the direct acetylation of flavonoids with phenolic acids.
