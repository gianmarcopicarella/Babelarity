Interstate 129 is a short east-west spur beginning at Interstate 29 in Sioux City. It enters South Sioux City via a bridge over the Missouri River, and crosses the southern end of South Sioux City with interchanges at Dakota Avenue (the city's main street) and U.S. Highway 77. Interstate 129 overlaps U.S. Highway 20 and U.S. Highway 75.
U.S. Highway 77 is a north-south highway whose northern terminus is at Interstate 29 in Sioux City.

In 1989, a large strip mall anchored by Wal-Mart and Hy-Vee opened along the bypass and effectively shifted the city's primary retail district from Dakota Avenue, in the center of town, to the western edge of the city.
