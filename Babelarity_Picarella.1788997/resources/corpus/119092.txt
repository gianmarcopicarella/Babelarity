His novel The Starcrossed, loosely based on his experiences, featured a thinly veiled characterization of his friend and colleague Harlan Ellison. Bova dedicated the novel to "Cordwainer Bird", the pen name Ellison uses when he does not want to be associated with a television or film project.
In 1974, he wrote the screenplay for an episode of the children's science-fiction television series Land of the Lost, titled "The Search".
