The Roundhouse Tapes is a live double album by Swedish progressive metal band Opeth. The CD was recorded on November 9, 2006, and was released on November 5, 2007, in Europe, and on November 20, 2007, in the rest of the world. A two disc DVD version was released on November 10, 2008, and includes exclusive menu music written by Mikael Åkerfeldt and Per Wiberg. The title is a play on the name of Iron Maiden's first release The Soundhouse Tapes, as well as the venue where the record was recorded. Åkerfeldt said, "The Roundhouse concert will always be a very memorable gig for us for many reasons, but most importantly it caught the band at the peak of the Ghost Reveries tour".
All lyrics written by Åkerfeldt, all music composed by Mikael Åkerfeldt except where noted.
The DVD also features fan and band interviews, sound-check footage and a photo gallery of the concert.
