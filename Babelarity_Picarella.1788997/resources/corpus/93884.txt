The blue-banded kingfisher (Alcedo euryzona), also called the Javan blue-banded kingfisher, is a species of bird in the family Alcedinidae that is endemic to the island of Java in Indonesia. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical mangrove forests, and rivers. It is critically endangered due to habitat loss. The Malay blue-banded kingfisher was recently differentiated from this species.
