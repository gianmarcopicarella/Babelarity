Lucas Rodrigo Biglia (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈlukas roˈðɾiɣo ˈβiɣlja]; born 30 January 1986) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays for Italian club Lazio.
Formerly of Argentinos Juniors and Independiente, he spent seven seasons with Anderlecht, where he made 312 appearances in the Belgian Pro League, winning four league titles.
Biglia's first senior international call-up was in 2011 and he previously played for the Argentina U20 national team, who won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship. He represented his nation at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, where they reached the final, and in three Copa América tournaments, winning runners-up medals in the 2015 and 2016 editions of the tournament.
Biglia started his career at Argentinos Juniors. However, a lack of first team appearances led to Biglia leaving the club after only 17 appearances and one goal scored. In 2005, he moved to Independiente for an undisclosed fee. In the first half of his season there, he made eleven appearances before becoming a first team player the following season, where he played in every game.
In July 2006, after one and a half-seasons at Independiente, Biglia signed with Belgian Pro League club Anderlecht on a four-year contract  where he took up the number five shirt. Biglia previously had trials with Spanish side Valencia and Villarreal. At Anderlecht, Biglia was a consistently good performer in midfield, and was made the club captain. Biglia's playing style is often compared with compatriot Fernando Redondo. Biglia is known for his accurate passing and hard tackling
In the 2006–07 season, Biglia made his debut against K. Sint-Truidense on the opening game of the season, coming on for an injured Mark De Man. Anderlecht won the match 4–2. Bigila had a difficult start, having been left out of the Belgian Supercup squad, which Anderlecht won for the second time in a row. Team-mate Yves Vanderhaeghe felt sympathy for him and helped him to settle in Belgium due to his ability to speak Spanish. He also made his Champions League debut, as Anderlecht drew 1–1 against French side Lille in the Group Stage. Bigila would soon become an important player, helping the team win the 2006–07 season. He was also awarded the Young Professional Footballer of the Year. Towards the end of the season he scored his first league goal from a penalty kick, as Anderlecht beat Brussels 6–0. The first game of the 2007-2008 season saw him provide an assist for Marcin Wasilewski as Anderlecht beat KV Mechelen 1–0. On 15 December 2007 Biglia signed a contract that kept him at the club until 2012. Anderlecht was unable to defend their league title as Standard Liège took the title in both the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 seasons. He scored his first European goal in a 2–2 draw against BATE Borisov during the Champions League Qualification. In the January transfer window, he was linked with European clubs such as Barcelona, Inter Milan, Valencia, Fenerbahce and Galatasaray. However, he remained at Anderlecht, insisting the club wanted him to stay.
On 17 October 2009, after scoring against Charleroi, Biglia stated that his goal was the greatest goal in his Anderlecht career. Biglia suffered a potentially serious injury to his ligament but managed to recover after it was found to be not as serious as first thought. Despite elimination from the Europa League, the club would win the league title in 2009–10.
The 2010–11 season was unsuccessful and in the January transfer window Galatasaray renewed their interest in him and made a bid of 4.5 million euros. The move never materialised due to a lack of funding.
In 2011–12 season, Biglia signed a new contract that would have kept him at the club until 2015. After the Copa América Biglia said he wanted to leave Anderlecht so that he could test himself in other leagues. Biglia was appointed vice-captain by new manager Ariël Jacobs, with Olivier Deschacht as captain. Biglia was later given captaincy after Deschacht was no longer able to continue the role. His captaincy was met with disapproval by supporters. Towards the end of October, he suffered a shoulder injury which had to be operated on and put him out for four months. He made his return on 15 January 2012, in a 3–0 win over Club Brugge. The club would win the 2011–12 season.
In the 2012–13 season, Biglia was linked with a move away from Anderlecht, with the likes of Arsenal, Norwich City, Real Madrid and Inter, showing an interest. However he remained at Anderlecht when the summer transfer window closed. In the January transfer window, Biglia again claimed he wanted to leave Anderlecht, with Southampton wanting to sign him. Biglia attempted to force a move by failing to show up for training. After the transfer window ended, the club announced that Biglia would leave the club in the summer, along with Dieumerci Mbokani. Biglia would claim that his absence was due to depression. He also stated that he never wanted to leave the club. Biglia made his first appearance, scoring but also receiving his first red card, as Anderlecht drew 2–2 against Standard. On the last game of the Jupiler Pro League play-off, Biglia scored the equaliser against Zulte Waregem, which gave Anderlecht the title.
Shortly after winning the title, general manager Herman Van Holsbeeck confirmed that Biglia would leave the club. During the final match, he performed a lap of honour for the fans.
On 23 July 2013, Italian side Lazio announced that Biglia would be signing a five-year contract for an undisclosed fee.
