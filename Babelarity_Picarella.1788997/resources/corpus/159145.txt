Mureck (Slovene: Cmurek, archaic: Cmürek) is a municipality in the district of Südoststeiermark in the Austrian state of Styria. On 1 January 2015, administrative reform actions in Styria merged the towns of Mureck, Gosdorf, and Eichfeld, which includes the villages of Hainsdorf-Brunnsee and Oberrakitsch. The new municipality is called Mureck.
Mureck is situated in the south of Styria at the border to Slovenia.

The name Mureck was first attested in 1151 as Mŏrekke (and as Murekke in 1181, Můrekke in 1183, and Muregk in 1500). The name is a compound of Mur 'Mur River' + Old High German ecke 'edge, bend' or egge 'hill' (sometimes 'fortification'), and thus means 'bend on the Mur River' or 'hill/fortification on the Mur River'. The Slovene name Cmurek is borrowed from the Middle High German prepositional phrase ze Murekke, literally 'at Mureck'. For similar Slovene geographical names based on foreign-language prepositional phrases of location, compare Crngrob, Cven, Dragonja, and Sostro.
Weckruf: Since 1954 the local marching band Grenzlandtrachtenkapelle Mureck practices the so-called wakening call (in German Weckruf) on every May 1 and wakes all friends of brass music with marching music in the early morning hours. Until 1964 all this happened by foot, later on they started using a nicely restored truck.
