1652 Hergé, provisional designation 1953 PA, is a stony asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, about 9 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Belgian astronomer Sylvain Arend at Royal Observatory of Belgium in Uccle on 9 August 1953.
The S-type asteroid is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.9–2.6 AU once every 3.38 years (1,233 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.15 and is tilted by 3 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. It has a rotation period of 16.4 hours and an assumed geometric albedo of 0.24.
The asteroid was named in honor of Belgian cartoonist Georges Remi, better known under his pseudonym Hergé. He is considered to be the father of the fictional Adventures of Tintin, one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century, and creator of its hero, Tintin, in 1929. The asteroid 1683 Castafiore was also named after the comic-strip character Bianca Castafiore from the series.
