Snyder is a town in, and the county seat of Scurry County, Texas, United States. The population was 10,653 at the 2010 census. The city is located in the lower part of the Southwestern Tablelands ecological region.
Snyder is named for merchant and buffalo hunter William Henry (Pete) Snyder, who built a trading post on Deep Creek in 1878. It soon drew fellow hunters and a small settlement grew up around the post. The nature of those early dwellings, mostly constructed of buffalo hide and tree branches, led to the communities first, if unofficial, name of "Hide Town". Another early name, "Robber's Roost" is said to owe its beginnings to the sometimes nefarious nature of a few residents and a lack of law enforcement. A statue of an albino buffalo on the grounds of the Scurry County courthouse in Snyder pays homage to the town's beginnings as a buffalo trading post.
Snyder predates Scurry County itself by two years, with a town plan being drawn up in 1882 while the county wasn't organized until 1884. A population of 600 was reported in 1892, with a school, two churches, a grist mill, steam gin, two banks and two weekly newspapers being part of the community. Significant change happened in 1907 when Snyder was granted a city charter, and construction began on the Roscoe, Snyder and Pacific Railway. The 1910 census indicated Snyder had grown to a population of 2,514. The Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway tracks reached Snyder in 1911, spurring further growth. Ranching and farming were the primary economic backbone of Snyder through the first half of the 20th century.
This changed in 1948 when oil was discovered in the Canyon Reef area north of town. Snyder became a boomtown as the population jumped to approximately 12,000 in just a year's time. By the time the boom ended in 1951 an estimated peak popularion of 16,000 had been reached. This soon decreased to the 10,000 to 11,000 level and stabilized. Although the boom was over, oil still remained a vital part of the local economy, with the Snyder area being one of the leading oil producing areas in Texas. In 1973 the one billionth barrel of oil was pumped from the nearby oil field.
An industrial base was established in the 1960s and early 1970s, diversifying the town's economy and making it less susceptible to cycles of boom and bust. Higher education came to Snyder in 1971 with the founding of Western Texas College. One of the most successful Texas Colleges for graduation and job placement, Western Texas offers Associate of Arts degree programs as well as vocational program certifications. Enrollment in 2009 was over 2,500 students.

McLaughlin, the museum houses over eighty bronze works and two hundred paintings. Among the collection are works by Peter Hurd and Andrew Wyeth.

Snyder enjoys a strong economy, driven by the oil, gas, and wind industries. In 2012, 994 jobs were created in Snyder, leading to 20% job growth in the community, according to the Development Corporation of Snyder. The Scurry Area Canyon Reef Operators (SACROC) oilfield is among the largest and most productive in the nation. Two of the largest wind farms in the nation are located in Snyder area.

Oil
In addition to the SACROC field, Snyder is also located within the footprint of the newly discovered Cline Shale. Devon Energy estimates the Cline Shale to produce 30 billion barrels of oil, surpassing the Bakken Shale in North Dakota and the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas. The thickness of the Cline Shale is equivalent to roughly ten Eagle Ford shales stacked on top of each other. As exploration and development of this new shale continues in the Snyder area, the city is expected to see a large population increase with new restaurants, apartments, and retail shopping.
Wind Energy
A section of the second largest wind farm in the United States, the Roscoe Wind Farm, is already located in the Snyder area. In late 2013 and 2014, Tri-Global Energy will begin construction on two new wind farms near Snyder. Combined, the Fluvanna Renewable Energy Project and the Canyon Wind project will add 700 MW wind capacity and represent a $1.4 billion investment in the Snyder and surrounding areas.
