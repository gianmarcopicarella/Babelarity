1717 Arlon, provisional designation 1954 AC, is a stony, binary asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, about 9 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Belgian astronomer Sylvain Arend at the Royal Observatory of Belgium in Uccle, on 8 January 1954.
The asteroid is a member of the Flora family, a large group or S-type asteroids dwelling in the inner main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.9–2.5 AU once every 3 years and 3 months (1,188 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.13 and is tilted by 6 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. It has a rotation period of 5.1 hours and an albedo of about 0.23, based on observations carried out by the Akari, WISE and NEOWISE missions.
In 2006 a team of astronomers at the Ondřejov Observatory near Prague, Czech Republic, announced the light-curve analysis suggests that Arlon has a asteroid moon orbiting once every 18.2 hours, at a distance of 16 kilometers. The moon is approximately 4 kilometers in diameter.
It is named after the Belgian town, municipality and capital of province, Arlon in Belgian Luxembourg, situated on a hill above the headwaters of the Semoise. The Orolaunum of the Romans was a station on the Antoninian way connecting Reims and Trier.
