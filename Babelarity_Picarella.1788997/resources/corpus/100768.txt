María Dolores Cospedal García (born 13 December 1965) is a Spanish politician who currently is the Secretary-General of the People's Party.
Her full name is María Dolores Cospedal García, Cospedal being her father's family name and García her mother's family name. At a certain point she started calling herself "de Cospedal" in public which sounded more aristocratic but more recently she has reverted to plain "Cospedal". In any case her legal name has always been just "Cospedal".
She was chosen as the People's Party (PP) candidate in the 2011 regional elections, for the presidency of the autonomous community of Castile-La Mancha. She obtained a majority with 48.13% of the votes which meant that for the first time in the history of democratic Spain the PP would govern the Junta of Communities of Castile-La Mancha (JCCM).
She also won in the 2015 regional elections, but she isn't now in the Government of Castile-La Mancha
