The Heterobathmioidea are a superfamily of the Lepidoptera, comprising the single family Heterobathmiidae, which itself contains only a single genus, Heterobathmia. Primitive, day-flying, metallic moths, confined to southern South America, the adults eat the pollen of Nothofagus or southern beech and the larvae mine the leaves (Kristensen, 1983, 1999). Most known species are undescribed (but see Kristensen and Nielsen, 1978, 1998).
