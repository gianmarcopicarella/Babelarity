The first settlers of European descent in the area were James O'Neill and his party, who arrived around 1845, looking for a location to build a sawmill along the Black River. The city was named in honor of O'Neill, as was O'Neill Creek, which runs through the center of the city and drains into the Black River.
In 1854, O’Neill’s Mill, as Neillsville was originally called, was selected as the county seat of Clark County.
Neillsville was platted on April 14, 1855 and incorporated in April 1882.
