Eraric (died 541) was briefly King of the Ostrogoths, elected as the most distinguished among the Rugians in the confederation of the Ostrogoths. He summoned a council directed to convincing the confederation to make peace with the Eastern Roman emperor Justinian, under Roman suzerainty. The Ostrogoths opposed the ceasefire under the negotiations, and they instead elected Ildibad's nephew Totila. Soon afterwards Eraric was killed by Totila's followers.
