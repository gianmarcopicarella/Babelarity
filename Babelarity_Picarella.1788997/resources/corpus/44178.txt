"Seemann" is a song by Rammstein, released as the second single from their LP Herzeleid. Its translation is "Seaman" or "Sailor".
The video shows Schneider, Riedel, Landers and Kruspe pulling a boat through the sand, with Lindemann and Flake, who's wearing a plague doctor mask, inside. Later, they decide to keelhaul Lindemann, still singing. The boat winds up in flames. The video is intertwined with shots of a woman, alternately dressed in a white robe and black clothing.

The first known performance of the song is from the New Year's Eve 1994-1995 concert in Saalfeld, Germany. It was probably played at every date of the Herzeleid tour. In the Sehnsucht tour, during this song, Flake (keyboard) usually sat in a small inflatable boat and sailed over the crowd who waves and bring the boat back to the stage after a short tour. This stunt is now performed in Haifisch instead of Seemann. Never played in the Mutter or Reise, Reise tours, Seemann was probably last played on June 23, 1999 in Los Angeles, California. Ten years later song returned only on few concerts during Liebe ist für alle da Tour. Seemann returned as a constant song for the Festival Tour 2016.
"Seemann" was covered by Finnish cello metal band Apocalyptica and featured Nina Hagen on the band's album, Reflections. It was released as a single on October 6, 2003. It was mixed and recorded by Mikko Raita.
