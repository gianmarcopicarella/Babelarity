The F major scale (or the key of F) consists of the pitches F, G, A, B♭, C, D, and E. Its key signature has one flat.
Its relative minor is D minor and its parallel minor is F minor.
F major key is the home key of the English horn, the basset horn, the horn in F, the trumpet in F and the bass Wagner tuba. Thus, music in F major for these instruments is written in C major key. Most of these sound a perfect fifth lower than written, with the exception of the trumpet in F which sounds a fourth higher. (The basset horn also often sounds an octave and a fifth lower.)
