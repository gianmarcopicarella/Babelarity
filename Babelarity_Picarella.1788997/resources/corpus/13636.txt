Ai Sugiyama (杉山愛, Sugiyama Ai, born July 5, 1975) is a Japanese former professional tennis player. She reached No. 1 in women's doubles on the WTA Tour. Her career-high singles ranking was No. 8, achieved on February 9, 2004. In her career, she won 6 singles titles and 37 doubles titles, including three Grand Slam women's doubles titles (one with Frenchwoman Julie Halard-Decugis and two partnering Belgian Kim Clijsters). Sugiyama held the all-time record, for both male and female players, for her 62 consecutive Grand Slam main draw appearances, until surpassed by Roger Federer in 2015 Wimbledon Championship by playing his 63rd consecutive Grand Slam.
In 1993, at age 17, Sugiyama played tennis legend Martina Navratilova in her native city, losing in three sets. The same year, she made her Grand Slam debut at Wimbledon but lost in the first round to world number 30 Gigi Fernández in three sets. In 1994, Sugiyama again reached the main draw at Wimbledon but lost in her first round to world number six and compatriot Kimiko Date. Later that year she reached her first singles final in Surabaya but was forced to retire against Elena Wagner. She went on to win the Japan Open doubles at Tokyo, her first tour title. Later that year, she broke into the WTA Top 100. In 1995, she won her first Grand Slam match and reached the 4th round of Roland Garros. In the first round, the Japanese player defeated 15th-seeded Grand Slam runner-up and former Top-5 player Helena Suková by 9–7 in the final set, her first victory over a Top-20 player. Two months after, she defeated Amanda Coetzer to reach the third round, while losing to world number four and former Wimbledon champion Conchita Martínez. In November, she made an impressive run at the Oakland Tier II tournament. While she was only ranked 63, she defeated 22nd-ranked Irina Spîrlea, former Wimbledon runner-up Zina Garrison Jackson, and number ten Lindsay Davenport to reach the second final of her career, where she lost to number seven Magdalena Maleeva. Because of this, Sugiyama broke into the Top 50.
In 1996, she reached the third round at the Australian Open. In Miami, seeded 23rd, Sugiyama reached the fourth round, defeating number ten Jana Novotná, her second Top-10 victory. That moved her into the Top-30. She also reached the semifinals of the Japan Open in Tokyo and the 4th round at Wimbledon, where she defeated number five Anke Huber, her third Top-10 and first Top-5 victory. She represented Japan and reached the 3rd round at the Atlanta Olympics defeating Martina Hingis.
In 1997, Sugiyama began her season by playing her third finals match, losing to Elena Likhovtseva, after defeating Sabine Appelmans in the quarter final. The following week she reached the 2nd round at the Australian Open. In April, she won her first professional title at the Japan Open in Tokyo against Amy Frazier. However, she could not reach a good result in Grand Slam events, with a 2nd round exit at the French Open and US Open and a first round loss at Wimbledon. At the end of the year, she reached her first Tier I final at the Kremlin Cup in Moscow, defeating Natasha Zvereva, number 14 Brenda Schultz-McCarthy, number 9 and multi-Grand Slam events winner Arantxa Sánchez Vicario, Dominique Van Roost before failing in the final against first seed and 2nd-ranked Jana Novotná.
In 1998, she opened with a second singles title in Gold Coast. Then she broke into the WTA Top-20 and reached another semifinal in Sydney, defeating Conchita Martínez. Throughout that year, Sugiyama showed consistency: a third WTA Tour title at the Japan Open, quarterfinals in Tokyo (Pan Pacific), Berlin, defeating number 4 Amanda Coetzer, playing Strasbourg and San Diego, defeating Steffi Graf, Luxembourg, third round in Indian Wells, Miami and Montreal and second round at both French and US Open. In 1999, she reached the final at the Japan Open, the semifinals in Gold Coast and Tokyo (Princess Cup) defeating number 8 Julie Halard-Decugis, the quarterfinals in Strasbourg and Moscow, defeating number 6 Mary Pierce, 3rd in Indian Wells, Montreal, defeating number 7 Jana Novotná and at the US Open. She also reached the second round at the French Open and Wimbledon. The same year, Sugiyama won the US Open mixed doubles with Mahesh Bhupathi (India), her first Grand Slam title.
On July 10 Sugiyama reached the final of the Women's Doubles at Wimbledon, partnered by Julie Halard-Decugis, but lost in straight sets to sisters Venus and Serena Williams 6–3 6–2 after a one-day rain delay. On September 10 Sugiyama won the Women's Doubles at the US Open, defeating Cara Black of Zimbabwe and Russian Elena Likhovtseva 6–0 1–6 6–1 in one hour and 19 minutes. On October 23 she became the first Japanese woman to rank number one in the world in doubles, winning seven titles in the process.
Sugiyama's greatest success was Scottsdale 2003. Beating Lindsay Davenport in the second round, Ai went on to defeat Eleni Daniilidou to progress to the semifinals. Scheduling problems forced both the semifinals and finals matches—for both singles and doubles—to be played on the Sunday of the tournament. Thus in a single day, Ai managed to save a matchpoint in the semifinals against Alexandra Stevenson, rally from a set down to defeat doubles partner Kim Clijsters in the final, and then secure victories in both doubles matches to raise both trophies. The year 2003 proved to be her best year ever, pushing Serena Williams to the limit at Roland Garros and reaching the round of 16 in Wimbledon and US Open where her fourth round loss to Francesca Schiavone at Flushing Meadows was rather controversial. She finished the year ranked tenth, having defeated world number one Justine Henin in the round robin section of the season-ending championships. She also won a total of 8 doubles titles that year: 7 with Kim Clijsters (Sydney, Antwerp, Scottsdale, Roland Garros, Wimbledon, San Diego, Zurich) and 1 with Liezel Huber (Linz).
Sugiyama began 2005 with four consecutive first-round losses. She lost in the first rounds of the first three Grand Slams; only at San Diego did she really do well, making it to the final, which she lost 0–6 3–6 to Mary Pierce, having defeated Daniela Hantuchová, Sesil Karantacheva and Svetlana Kuznetsova en route. Sugiyama also reached the final in doubles with Hantuchová, losing to Virginia Ruano-Pascual and Conchita Martínez. She broke her Grand Slam "curse", reaching the third round before losing to Clijsters, the eventual champion.
That year, Ai had better results in doubles than in singles. Partnering with Elena Dementieva, she reached the finals of her first tournament, Sydney, losing to Bryanne Stewart/Samantha Stosur. They reached the Round of 16 at the Australian Open. She entered a few tournaments with Anastasia Myskina and Elena Likhovtseva, but with poor results. In Berlin, she played again with Daniela Hantuchová, reaching the Semifinal, losing to Black and Huber. At the French, they lost to Birnerová and Vanc in the second round.
