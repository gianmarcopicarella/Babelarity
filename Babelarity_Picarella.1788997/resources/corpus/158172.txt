Dengfeng (Chinese: 登封; pinyin: Dēngfēng; postal: Tengfeng) is a county-level city in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, China. In ancient times, it was known as Yangcheng (simplified Chinese: 阳城; traditional Chinese: 陽城; pinyin: Yángchéng).
Dengfeng has an area of 1220 square kilometers and a population of 630,000.
Dengfeng is located at the foot of the Mount Song, one of the most sacred mountains in China. The city is one of the most renowned spiritual centres of China, home to various religious institutions and temples, such as the Taoist Zhongyue Temple, the Buddhist Shaolin Temple, as well as the Confucian Songyang Academy, hence its poetic expression derived from Chinese literature as the spiritual "centre of heaven and earth".
The first Xia Dynasty capital Yangcheng was built west of Gaocheng Township on the Yin River under the sacred Mount Song.
The famous Shaolin Monastery, traditional origin of Zen, is located in Dengfeng.
In 2010, UNESCO inscribed several of the most renowned sites across Dengfeng onto its World Heritage List under the title "Historic Monuments of Dengfeng in 'The Centre of Heaven and Earth'."
