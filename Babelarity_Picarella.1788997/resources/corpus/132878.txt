Abercius of Hieropolis (Greek Αβέρκιος, died ca. 167) was a bishop of Hierapolis (modern Castabala) at the time of Marcus Aurelius, also known as Abercius Marcellus. He was supposedly the successor to Papias.
He is said to have evangelized Syria and Mesopotamia, and is on that basis referred to as one of the Equals-to-the-Apostles. He was imprisoned under Marcus Aurelius, and died about 167.
His feast day is celebrated on October 22 (for those churches which follow the Julian Calendar, October 22 occurs on the Gregorian Calendar date of November 4).
Several works are ascribed to him:
An Epistle to the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, of which Baronius speaks as extant, but he does not produce it
A Book of Discipline (Greek Βίβλος διδασκαλίας) addressed to his clergy; this too is lost.
He is also the subject, and probable author, of the Inscription of Abercius, preserved in the Vatican Museum.
