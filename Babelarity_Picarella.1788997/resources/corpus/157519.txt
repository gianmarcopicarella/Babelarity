Halfway is a small town in Baker County, Oregon, United States. This town took its name from the location of its post office, on the Alexander Stalker ranch, half way between Pine and Cornucopia. The population was 288 at the 2010 census.
During the dot-com boom, Halfway agreed to rename itself as Half.com, Oregon for a year as a publicity stunt for the e-commerce company of the same name.
The area was originally used as hunting territory by the Nez Perce, Umatilla and Shoshone tribes.
It was explored and mapped by Benjamin Bonneville in the 1830s and first settled by Euro-Americans in the 1860s. The smaller national forests, now combined into the local Wallowa–Whitman National Forest, were created in 1908.
While a post office was established in 1887, the town was platted in another location in 1907, the post office moved there in 1908, and it incorporated in 1909.
The town has always been primarily a farming and ranching community. There was a small gold rush to nearby Cornucopia, now a ghost town, and some timber industry in the early 20th century. Major employer, the Idaho Power Company, now operates three hydroelectric dams on the Snake River.
Halfway earned a place in the history of the dot-com era in December 1999, when it received and accepted an offer to rename itself as Half.com, Oregon, after the e-commerce start-up, for one year in exchange for $110,000; 20 computers for the school; and other financial subsidies. It became the first city in the world to rename itself as a dot com. Among the less obvious reasons the town was chosen were its small population size (and thus its likelihood to accept such an offer) and the city's location, which fit perfectly into Half.com's marketing scheme. "They're within four miles of the 45th parallel which makes it halfway between the equator and the North Pole". The proclamation did not legally change its name. The city created and posted two signs at its borders that greeted visitors with "America's First Dot-com City". The city auctioned one of these off in September 2007 for $1000; the winner was Half.com's founder Josh Kopelman.
Half.com was bought by eBay in February 2001.
The original financial hardships that led to the city accepting Half.com's offer returned in 2004, when a company owning a promissory note secured by its fairgrounds and improvements demanded payment of over $530,000.
Halfway is located 54 miles (87 km) east of Baker City, along Oregon Route 86, half way between Pine and Cornucopia, which gave the town its name The city's geographic coordinates of 44°52′42″N 117°6′38″W (being close to 45° N) were part of the reason for Half.com to choose the town for its advertising gimmick.
