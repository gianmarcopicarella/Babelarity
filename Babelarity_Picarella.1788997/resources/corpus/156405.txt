Vilada is a municipality in the comarca of Berguedà, Catalonia, of about 500 residents. Its name is documented in the 9th century as Villalata, translated as “ample town.”
Vilada has no demonym. While the appropriate name in Catalan would be Viladí or Viladina, this can cause confusion with residents of a neighborhood of the comarca's capital, Berga, named “Viladins.” Therefore, residents are simply de Vilada.
