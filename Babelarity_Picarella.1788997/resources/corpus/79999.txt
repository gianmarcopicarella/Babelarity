Jean Carmet (25 April 1920 – 20 April 1994) was a French actor.
Jean Carmet began working on stage and then in film in the early 1940s becoming a very popular comedic actor in his native country. He is best known internationally for his role as a French colonist in the 1976 film, La Victoire en Chantant (Black and White in Color).
Because of his good-natured manner, he was as popular with members of the film crew as he was with the audiences. During his long career, he appeared in more than 200 films, and although he played dramatic parts, he usually acted in a supporting role as a comedic character.
He was nominated for the César Award for Best Actor for his leading role in the 1986 film, Miss Mona. Twice he won the César Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and was nominated on two other occasions. In February 1994, to celebrate his 50th year in film, he was honored by the French motion picture industry with a special César Award. Just a few months later, Jean Carmet died of a heart attack.
Jean Carmet is interred in the Cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris. In his birthplace of Bourgueil, a theater and an avenue were named in his honor.
