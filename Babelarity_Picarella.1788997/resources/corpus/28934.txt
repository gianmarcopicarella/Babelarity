A countermeasure is a measure or action taken to counter or offset another one. As a general concept it implies precision, and is any technological or tactical solution or system (often for a military application) designed to prevent an undesirable outcome in the process. The first known use of the term is in 1923.
Countermeasures can refer to the following disciplinary spectrum:
Defense
Medicine
Materials engineering
Electro-magnetic engineering
Policing
Information technology
Law
Diplomatic security
Pollution prevention
Defense countermeasures are often subdivided into "active" and "passive" countermeasures.
In military applications, "active" countermeasures which alter the electromagnetic, acoustic or other signature(s) of a target thereby altering the tracking and sensing behavior of an incoming threat (e.g., guided missile) are designated soft-kill measures. Measures that physically counterattack an incoming threat thereby destroying/altering its payload/warhead in such a way that the intended effect on the target is majorly impeded are designated hard-kill measures. Both are further described in active protection systems.
"Passive" countermeasures include:
Armor
Camouflage
Fortification
Self-sealing fuel tank
Anti-aircraft
Anti-ballistic missile
Electronic countermeasures
Flare (countermeasure)
Infrared countermeasures
Mine countermeasures
National Missile Defense
Strategic Defense Initiative
