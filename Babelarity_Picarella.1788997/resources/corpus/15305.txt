In 1992–93, the Serie A title was retained by Milan, who finished four points ahead of Inter Milan. Third placed Parma enjoyed European glory in the European Cup Winners Cup, while unfancied Cagliari crept into the UEFA Cup qualification places at the expense of the 1991 champions and 1992 European Cup finalists Sampdoria. Roma and Napoli finished mid table after disappointing campaigns, while Brescia, Fiorentina, Ancona and Pescara were all relegated.
