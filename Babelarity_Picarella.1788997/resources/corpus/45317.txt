A Show of Hands is a live album by the Canadian rock band Rush, released in 1989. The band released a video of the same name, originally on VHS and LaserDisc, the same year. A DVD version was released as part of a box set in 2006, and as an individual DVD in 2007.
The album was recorded in the American cities of New Orleans, Phoenix, and San Diego, and the British city of Birmingham, during the 1988 Hold Your Fire tour, along with East Rutherford, New Jersey during the 1986 Power Windows tour. The opening track "Intro" features The Three Stooges theme playing in the background; the band used this music to open many of their concerts during the 1980s.
The video was filmed at the first of two Birmingham (UK) shows which took place on 23–24 April 1988, one of the sources of the live album. The song order and selection of the video are different from the live album.
All songs written by Alex Lifeson, Geddy Lee and Neil Peart, except where noted.
