Jonjo Shelvey /ˈdʒɒndʒoʊ ˈʃɛlvi/ (born 27 February 1992) is an English professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Championship club Newcastle United and the England national team. Known as a gifted playmaker and passer of the ball, he excels at long range shooting.
He began his career at Charlton Athletic, becoming their youngest-ever player at 16 years and 59 days old. In 2010 he moved to Liverpool for an initial £1.7 million, spending a brief loan at Blackpool. During his time at Anfield, Shelvey was part of a Liverpool squad which won the League Cup and lost the FA Cup final in 2012. He joined Swansea City for £5 million in 2013, and Newcastle United for £12 million two-and-a-half-years later. A month after joining Newcastle, he was made the team's stand-in captain, as the season ended with relegation.
Shelvey played for England at under-16, under-17, under-19 and under-21 level and has captained the under-19 side. He won his first cap for the senior side in 2012.
Shelvey played in the youth teams of first Arsenal and then West Ham United, the team he had supported as a boy. In 2004, he moved to Charlton Athletic, making his breakthrough in the 2007–08 season after scoring 14 goals in 23 appearances for Charlton's Under 18s. He made his first-team debut on 26 April 2008, starting in a 3–0 away loss against Barnsley in the Football League Championship. He became Charlton's youngest-ever player, at the age of 16 years and 59 days – beating the previous holder, Paul Konchesky. He still had one week of school remaining when he was given his debut by manager Alan Pardew.
On 3 January 2009, Shelvey became Charlton's youngest-ever goal-scorer, with a strike against Norwich City in the third round of the FA Cup, opening a 1–1 draw. It was 54 days before his 17th birthday, breaking the previous record held by Peter Reeves who was aged 17 years and 100 days when he scored – also against Norwich – in May 1996. Despite interest from several Premier League clubs, on 27 February, his 17th birthday, Shelvey signed his first professional contract with Charlton. He scored his first league goal in the 3–2 win at Southampton on 4 April. Later that month, he scored in consecutive games, 2–2 home draws against Blackpool and Cardiff City; the season ended with relegation to League One.
On 9 September 2009, he signed a one-year contract extension until 2012. Shelvey contributed four goals from 24 league appearances as the Addicks reached the promotion play-offs.
Shelvey signed for Liverpool in May 2010, for an initial fee of £1.7 million. He made his debut for the club as an extra-time substitute on 22 September in the Reds' shock League Cup third-round defeat against League Two side Northampton Town at Anfield, with Liverpool losing 4–2 on penalties (with Shelvey scoring in the shootout) after a 2–2 draw. Shelvey started his first game for the club in Liverpool's Europa League group game against Napoli on 21 October 2010, playing the whole 90 minutes match in a 0–0 draw. On 24 October, Shelvey made his Premier League debut against Blackburn Rovers at Anfield, coming on for the final stages in place of Raul Meireles in the Reds' 2–1 win.
Shelvey joined Championship club Blackpool on loan on 30 September 2011. The following day he scored on his debut, in a 5–0 win against Bristol City at Bloomfield Road, and also scored his first professional hat-trick in a 5–0 win away at Leeds United on 3 November.
On 30 November 2011 he was recalled by Liverpool due to injury problems within the team, mainly surrounding Steven Gerrard and Lucas Leiva, with the latter set to miss the remainder of the season. He made his first ever Premier League start the following weekend against Aston Villa. On 6 January 2012 he scored his first senior goal for the club in a 5–1 win in a third round FA Cup tie against Oldham Athletic at Anfield, and on 8 May he scored his first Premier League goal with a 30-yard strike in a 4–1 home win over Chelsea. He was absent from Liverpool's win over Cardiff City in the season's League Cup Final, and was an unused substitute in their loss to Chelsea in the FA Cup equivalent.
On 10 July 2012 Shelvey signed a new long-term contract with Liverpool. On 20 September 2012 he came off the bench to score the last 2 goals in a 5–3 win against Young Boys in the Europa League. Three days later, he was sent off in a league game against Manchester United on 23 September 2012. He finished the Europa group stage with four goals, adding one each in a home defeat to Udinese on 4 October, and a draw with Young Boys on 22 November.
On 3 July 2013, Shelvey signed a four-year contract with Swansea City, for an initial transfer fee of £5 million. He scored his first goal for the club on 16 September 2013, in a 2–2 draw with former club Liverpool, also assisting team-mate Michu's goal, but was partly responsible for both Liverpool goals, giving the ball away to Daniel Sturridge and Victor Moses. He scored a goal on 26 April 2014 in a 4–1 defeat of Aston Villa; from Brad Guzan's clearance, Shelvey "controlled the ball with one touch before propelling it over the back-pedalling American's head and into the net."
Shelvey was sent off in a goalless draw at Everton on 1 November 2014. On 29 December, he caught Liverpool's Emre Can with his arm during a 1–4 defeat. Although referee Andre Marriner did not punish him for it, the FA later gave Shelvey a four-match suspension for violent conduct, with one match having been added to the suspension because of his previous dismissal against Everton. He claimed that the act was unintentional and personally apologised to Can. The day before the Liverpool match, Swansea manager Garry Monk criticised Shelvey's disciplinary record, telling him to "wise up" and put a stop to an accumulation of yellow cards earned through "laziness".
In July 2015, Shelvey signed a new four-year deal with the Swans, keeping him at the club until the summer of 2019.
On 10 January 2016, following a shock 3–2 defeat to League Two side Oxford United in the FA Cup, Shelvey appeared to become embroiled in a row with one Swansea fan and then appeared to invite the man to meet him outside. Manager Alan Curtis responded stating "we expect more from Jonjo, it is as simple as that."
On 12 January 2016, Newcastle United announced they had signed Shelvey on a five-and-a-half-year deal, for a reported fee of £12 million. He was given the squad number 12. Four days later he made his debut in a 2–1 Premier League victory over West Ham United, the first win for the club in seven games. He was named man of the match for his involvement in the build-up to both of Newcastle's goals.
While Newcastle were on a training break in La Manga on 20 February, manager Steve McClaren announced that Shelvey had been made the team's captain. He served the role as Fabricio Coloccini stayed out through a calf injury, and said that he wanted to help the club avoid relegation; they were unsuccessful in that aim.
Shelvey captained the England under-16s as they won the 2007 Victory Shield scoring three goals in three games. He played a key role in the Montaigu Tournament, which England won for the first time in seven years, playing in all four games and scoring a free kick in the final against France. In October 2008, he made his debut for the England under-17s and scored in a 7–0 win over Estonia.
On his debut for the England under-19s, in September 2010, he captained and scored a free-kick in a 2–0 win over Slovakia, and followed up by scoring on his following two appearances for the side. He won his first Under-21 cap coming on as substitute in a 6–0 win against Azerbaijan in September 2011.
England's senior manager Roy Hodgson claimed that Shelvey missed the 2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship because he was "reticent" about playing at that level following his senior international debut. Shelvey responded by saying that he had been told by under-21 manager Gareth Southgate that he would not feature in that squad, and claimed that if he had ever refused international duty he would have faced the wrath of his father.
Shelvey was eligible to play for Scotland – through his grandfather – and the Republic of Ireland, however chose to represent England. In October 2012 Shelvey was called up for the England squad for two 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification games against San Marino and Poland, and made his senior debut from the bench on 12 October 2012, in a 5–0 home win against San Marino, replacing Michael Carrick in the 66th minute.
On 5 September 2015, Shelvey was selected to start for England for the first time in a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying match against San Marino, becoming the first man to be capped for England whilst playing for Swansea City. He was named Man of the Match by the BBC as England ran out 6–0 winners in Serravalle.
Shelvey was born in Romford, London and grew up in a council flat in Harold Hill. Due to crime in the neighbourhood, he bought his sister a home in Brentwood when she became pregnant. His older brother George was, according to Shelvey, a better footballer, but his career was ruined by drinking and partying.
Shelvey fell down a staircase as a baby, one of several childhood traumas which he believes could have caused the alopecia which caused his hair loss. He was prescribed a cream and told to sleep in a woolly hat for a month in order to combat it, but abandoned treatment because of the discomfort it caused, and said of his baldness, "If you don't like it, don't talk to me". Shelvey has supported youngsters who share his condition.
In June 2015, Shelvey married Daisy Evans, formerly of the pop group S Club 8. Comedian Jimmy Carr performed at the event. The couple have a daughter, born the previous year. After his marriage, Shelvey advertised for a live-in chef, who would receive an annual salary of £65,000. He stated that his family responsibilities and new diet would improve his professional behaviour.
