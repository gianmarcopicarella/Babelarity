Weed's city motto is "Weed like to welcome you". It has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names.
The town of Weed gets its name from the founder of the local lumber mill and pioneer Abner Weed, who discovered that the area's strong winds were helpful in drying lumber. In 1897, Abner Weed bought the Siskiyou Lumber and Mercantile Mill and 280 acres (1.1 km2) of land in what is now the City of Weed, for the sum of $400. By the 1940s Weed boasted the world's largest sawmill.
On September 15, 2014, a fast moving wildfire called the "Boles Fire" spread through the town with massive force fueled by 40-mph winds. The fire started behind the Boles Creek Apartments in the central part of Weed at approximately 1:30pm and within 4 hours quickly spread to over 200 acres. Evacuations were immediately ordered and a shelter was first set up at College of the Siskiyous, but as fire headed towards the college, the evacuation center was relocated to the Siskiyou Golden Fairgrounds in Yreka, then Yreka and Mount Shasta High Schools, then the Armory in Mt. Shasta.
Over 200 structures were damaged or destroyed, including the high school, elementary school and Roseburg mill, many homes, and businesses. The schools and mill only sustained minimal damage to outbuildings. About 7,678 Pacific Power customers in both Weed and Mt. Shasta lost power as a result of the fire.

From its founding in 1901, to as late as the 1980s, Weed was home to a thriving lumber industry. Roseburg Forest Products (Plywood Production), International Paper Company, Morgan Products Ltd. (Wooden Door Manufacturing), and J.H. Baxter (Wood Treatment) were all located in Weed. The historic industrial area at the northeast corner of town has been plagued with environmental concerns and clean-up efforts as a result of chemicals used for wood treatment, as well as chemical residue from glue used in the door factory.
Although historically reliant on logging, wood processing and forest-related products, Weed's economy has become more reliant on tourism as a source of economic activity. Weed's microbrewery, Mt. Shasta Brewing Company, relies on tourists for 92% of its business, according to co-owner Vaune Dillman.
Today, most of the wood-product-related industry has been scaled back or ceased altogether, and new retail and light industrial activity is concentrated in the south-east corner of Weed. Retail at the south end of town, in the form of restaurants and hotels, caters primarily to tourist travel on the Interstate 5 corridor. Light manufacturing of bottled water from Crystal Geyser Water Company has also added economic stability to the area.
Weed is part of the Shasta Valley Enterprise Zone which provides tax breaks, fee reductions, and permit fast-tracking for employers locating in the area.

Weed's historic lumber industry and manufacturing facilities made it a magnet for ethnic minority migration, that may not have otherwise been the case in this region of the country. A large number of Italian immigrants migrated to Weed, and other towns in southern Siskiyou County at the turn of the 20th century. While immigrants were a source of labor for the region, they were not always well treated, in fact in 1909 complaints from workers in the lumber industry reached the Italian consular. However, in time the Italian population came to be a cornerstone of Weed civic life. Many streets in the early Italian neighborhood bear names of Italian cities, such as Rome, Genoa, Como, and Venice. Annually since 1954, the town has held the Weed Italian Carnevale in June or July, although recently dropping "Italian" from its name while maintaining the Italian spelling of carnival and the traditional bocce ball tournaments.
A large number of black-Americans migrated to Weed as well, to work in Long-Bell Lumber Company's Weed facility after the company closed two mills in Louisiana in 1922. The company promised to advance travel expenses and provide housing for workers relocating to Weed. Immigrants locating in Weed since the 1980s have come primarily from Mexico and Laos. As a result of these migrations, Weed has a much more ethnically diverse population than Siskiyou County as a whole. Netting the Hispanic or Latino population out of Census figures for White Race, Weed's white population is 60.6% compared to Siskiyou County at 79.5% under the same method.
