Mališevo or Malishevë (Albanian Malishevë or Malisheva; Serbian: Малишево, Mališevo; Turkish: Malişova) is a town and municipality in the Prizren District of central Kosovo. The town itself has approximately 2,300 inhabitants while the municipality has an estimated 56,889 inhabitants.
The town was a stronghold for the ethnically Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army during the Kosovo War in 1999. The United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) formally re-established the municipality of Mališevo in July 2000. During the war, a number of atrocities were committed by both Albanian and Yugoslav forces. One such incident occurred in Mališevo, the execution of no fewer than seven Serbian men, named the Mališevo Massacre. The UN-run Office on Missing Persons and Forensics began the excavations at the site in May 2005.
