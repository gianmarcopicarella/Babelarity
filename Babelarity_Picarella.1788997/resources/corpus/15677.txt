Jorge Luis Pinto Afanador (born 16 December 1952) is a Colombian football coach, and incumbent manager of the Honduras national football team.
Pinto managed several teams in Colombia, including Santa Fe and Union Magdalena on two occasions, before joining Club Alianza Lima (Peru) in 1997. The team was able to win the 1997 Torneo Descentralizado, after an 18-year drought. Afterwards, he left the club and returned to Colombia.
After an unsuccessful attempt at Coaching Costa Rica in 2004-2005, Pinto returned to Colombia to coach a recently promoted team Corporación Nuevo Cúcuta Deportivo which he led to win their first Colombian National Championship in their history.
Shortly afterward he was named the new Colombia national football team coach. His job was highly criticized by the general public after very bad showings against Uruguay and Chile in 2010 World Cup Qualifying matches as well as in the 2007 Copa America 2007. Jorge Luis Pinto took the Colombia national football team to one of the best starts in FIFA World Cup Qualifying in Colombian football history, obtaining 10 points out of a possible 16 points. However, due to several lackluster performances later on, Colombia ended in 7th place and failed to qualify to the FIFA World Cup 2010.
In 2011 he became manager of Costa Rica once again, and on 10 September 2013 qualified for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. Costa Rica ended in second place in the CONCACAF World Cup qualification. He was voted as CONCACAF's best coach of 2014 after the World Cup, beating United States head coach Jurgen Klinsmann.
In the 2014 FIFA World Cup Pinto secured a 3-1 victory for Costa Rica over Uruguay and another 1-0 victory over Italy. After a 0-0 draw against England, Costa Rica finished first in what many called the "Group of Death", the second time Costa Rica made it to the World Cup Round of 16. On 29 June 2014, Costa Rica defeated Greece on penalties and went through to the Quarter Finals of the 2014 World Cup. His team eventually lost on penalties to the Netherlands in the Quarter Finals, after a goalless draw.
In December 2014 he became manager of the Honduras national team.
