Stanwood High School has about 1,800 students and 87 teachers, and is still growing. A bond was made in May 2006 for a new high school that would help relieve the growing population, but was turned down. When the school was built in 1971, it was originally made to hold 800 students. It was originally built as a "California-style" high school, where there were no hallways, and everything was accessed from outside. Since then, additions have been made in 1980, 1993, and 2001.
