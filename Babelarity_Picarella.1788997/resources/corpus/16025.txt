The Los Angeles Aztecs were a soccer team that competed in the North American Soccer League from 1974–81. The team was based in Los Angeles, California and part-owned (for a time) by Elton John.
The Aztecs are remembered for their mixed success and were sometimes compared to the New York Cosmos as the Cosmos of the West Coast. However, they did not draw nearly as well as the Cosmos, or even the Seattle Sounders, who were consistently the attendance leaders among the Western NASL teams . They won the 1974 NASL Championship over the Miami Toros. In 1976, a fading George Best signed alongside Ron Davies and played from 1976 to 1978. In 1979 attendance peaked (with an average attendance of around 14,000) as manager Rinus Michels signed the Dutch superstar Johan Cruyff who went on to win the NASL Most Valuable Player Award in his one year with the Aztecs. In 1981, their final season, the Aztecs were managed by former Brazil manager Cláudio Coutinho, who died after the season ended as a result of a scuba diving accident in Brazil.
