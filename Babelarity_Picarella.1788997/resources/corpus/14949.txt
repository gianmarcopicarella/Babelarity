Daryl Janmaat (born 22 July 1989) is a Dutch professional footballer who plays for Newcastle United and the Dutch national team as a right back.
He began his career at ADO Den Haag, and went on to play for the Eredivisie clubs Heerenveen and Feyenoord before joining Newcastle on a six-year deal in 2014.
A full international since 2012, Janmaat has earned over 20 caps and was part of the Dutch team which finished third at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
Born in Leidschendam, South Holland, Janmaat started his senior career in 2007–08, with ADO Den Haag in the Eerste Divisie.
In the following off-season the 19-year-old moved straight into the Eredivisie, signing for SC Heerenveen. In Heerenveen's Europa League match against Hertha Berlin on 23 October 2009, Janmaat came on as a 73rd-minute substitute for Norwegian Christian Grindheim and received a red card three minutes later for a late challenge on Nemanja Pejčinović but Heerenveen held on for a 1–0 victory. After serving a required suspension, Janmaat scored in his next Europa League appearance on 16 December 2009, netting his side's final goal in a 5–0 win over FK Ventspils at the Abe Lenstra Stadion in Heerenveen but the win proved insufficient as Heerenveen failed to qualify for the knockout stages.
On 21 December 2011, Janmaat scored Heerenveen's ninth goal in a 11–1 thrashing of Eerste Divisie side FC Oss to reach the quarter-finals of the KNVB Beker. During his four seasons with the club Janmaat was a starter in three after appearing in only ten games in his debut campaign, which ended with conquest of the Dutch Cup.
In the middle of 2012, after his contract expired, he signed for fellow top-division side Feyenoord, which he had already represented as a youth. Janmaat picked up two yellow cards in the space of one minute and was sent off on 9 December 2012 as Feyenoord drew with NAC Breda 2–2 in league play. On 17 March 2013, he scored the winning goal for Feyenoord as they defeated FC Utrecht 2–1.
Janmaat scored his first goal of the 2013–14 Eredivisie season on 16 February 2014, converting a pass from Graziano Pellè as Feyenoord drew 1–1 with NAC Breda. On 13 April, he scored on the half-volley in the 76th minute as Feyenoord defeated PSV 2–0 in league play.
On 17 July 2014, Janmaat joined Premier League club Newcastle United on a six-year deal for an undisclosed fee. He made his competitive debut on 17 August, playing the full 90 minutes and being booked as Newcastle began their league campaign with a 2–0 home defeat to Manchester City. Janmaat's first goal for Newcastle was in a 3–3 draw against Crystal Palace on 30 August. His second for the club came against Football League 2 outfit Northampton Town, scoring the 3rd goal in a 4–1 away victory in the League Cup. Janmaat then scored his 3rd goal for Newcastle in a 2-1 defeat by Watford.
Janmaat made his debut for the Netherlands on 7 September 2012, playing the full 90 minutes in a 2–0 home win against Turkey for the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. On 31 May 2014, he was selected by national team manager Louis van Gaal to the final 23-man squad for the World Cup in Brazil. He played his first game in the tournament on 13 June, providing an assist, as Holland thrashed defending champions Spain 5–1. In the third-place playoff match against host nation Brazil, Janmaat came on as a late substitute for Daley Blind and provided the assist for Georginio Wijnaldum as Holland won 3–0.
