The Vanuatu national football team is the national team of Vanuatu and is controlled by the Vanuatu Football Federation.
It was known as the New Hebrides national football team until the New Hebrides became Republic of Vanuatu in 1980. It finished fourth in the OFC Nations Cup in 1973, 2000, and 2002. In the 2004 Oceania Nations Cup, Vanuatu beat New Zealand 4–2, preventing the regional powerhouse from making the final and, consequently, the running for the 2006 World Cup.
Vanuatu caused another shock in the 2007 South Pacific Games by knocking out the Solomon Islands for bronze medal and also enable to enter the second stage of qualification for the OFC nation Cup and consequently a chance with a playoff for the FIFA World Cup in South Africa in 2010. The last time they had won against Solomon Islands was back in 1998 and had since been on the receiving side of many losses save for one draw against them. In July 2008, Vanuatu faced two national teams from the Solomon Islands during the inaugural edition of the Wantok Cup. Vanuatu lost 1–2 to the Solomons' team A, but defeated their team B by two goals to one.
For the first time in the country's history Vanuatu was top of the South Pacific in 1990. Vanuatu won the Melanesian Cup, playing against Solomon Islands, Fiji, Papua New Guinea and New Caledonia. At that time under Coach Terry O'Donnell, Vanuatu was undoubtably the best team in the South Pacific beating Australia 1 v 0 and also knocking New Zealand out of the Futsal World Cup.
The Vanuatu Football Federation selected recently three Portuguese nationalized players to increase their chances to qualify to the World Cup. This players consist of E. Rangel, J. Carlos and P.V. (known by this name as a professional football player), that all play for the newly created football team of Vanuatu, called the Fraudsters, owned by an investment fund from Equatorial Guinea.
1930 to 1990 – Did not enter
1994 to 2018 – Did not qualify
At the second stage of the qualification tournament, Vanuatu came 6th place at the bottom of the table, but managed a win against regional powerhouses New Zealand which denied them a place in the final stages of OFC Nation Cup and the chance for a place in both the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup and Continental & Intercontinental playoffs for the 2006 World Cup Finals. Vanuatu's win created the first time opportunity for one of the Island Nations to contest the Third Stage which had previously been contested only by Australia and New Zealand. Australia went on to beat Solomon Islands in a two leg contest and qualified for the World Cup finals.
