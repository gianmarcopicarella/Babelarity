Giorgio Scarlatti (2 October 1921 â€“ 26 July 1990) was a racing driver from Italy. He participated in 15 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 13 May 1956.
Scarlatti's best season in Formula One was as a works Maserati driver in 1957, when he finished sixth in the Pescara Grand Prix, narrowly missing out on the points-scoring positions when he was overtaken in the latter stages by Stuart Lewis-Evans. He later scored his only championship point when Harry Schell took over the Italian's Maserati 250F during the Italian Grand Prix and finished fifth.
