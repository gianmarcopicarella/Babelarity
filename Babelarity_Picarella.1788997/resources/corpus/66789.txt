Fritz Machlup (German: [ˈmaχlʊp]; December 15, 1902 – January 30, 1983) was an Austrian-American economist. He was notable for being one of the first economists to examine knowledge as an economic resource.
He was born to Jewish parents in Wiener-Neustadt, Austria, near Vienna; his father was a businessman who owned two factories that manufactured cardboard. Machlup earned his doctorate at the University of Vienna. He fled Austria for the United States in 1933 and became a US citizen in 1940.
Machlup's key work was The Production and Distribution of Knowledge in the United States (1962), which is credited with popularizing the concept of the information society.
He was president of the International Economic Association from 1971–1974.
Shortly before his death he completed the third in a series of ten planned volumes collectively called Knowledge: Its Creation, Distribution, and Economic Significance.
Machlup is also credited with forming the Bellagio Group in the early 1960s. This group was the direct predecessor of the influential Washington-based financial advisory body, the Group of Thirty, which he joined in 1979.
