The Possibilists (French: Possibilistes) were a faction of the French socialist movement led by Paul Brousse, Beno√Æt Malon and others who brought about a split in the Federation of the Socialist Workers of France in 1882. Its leaders proclaimed what was essentially a reformist principle of achieving only what is 'possible', which they claimed was not the workers revolution. The political party of the Possibilists merged with other groups into the French Section of the Workers' International.
