374 Burgundia is a typical main belt asteroid that was discovered by Auguste Charlois on September 18, 1893 in Nice. It was named for the former French region of Burgandy. It is one of seven of Charlois's discoveries that was expressly named by the Astromomisches Rechen-Institut (Astronomical Calculation Institute).
Burgundia was long thought to be a member of the now defunct Ceres asteroid family, but it was found to be an unrelated interloper in that group based on its non-matching composition.
