Nance County is a county located in the U.S. state of Nebraska. As of the 2010 census, the population was 3,735. Its county seat is Fullerton.
In the Nebraska license plate system, Nance County is represented by the prefix 58 (it had the fifty-eighth-largest number of vehicles registered in the county when the license plate system was established in 1922).
The land that comprises Nance County was originally part of the Pawnee Reservation, created in 1857 when the Pawnee Indians signed a treaty with the United States ceding its lands in exchange for the reservation. After the state of Nebraska was admitted into the Union, the state government extinguished the tribe's rights to their land. It soon sold the land and used the proceeds to defray expenses to obtain lands elsewhere for the Indians. In the mid-1870s the remainder of the reservation was sold, and in 1876 the tribe was relocated to its present-day location in central Oklahoma. The boundaries for Nance County were approved in 1879. It was named after Governor Albinus Nance.
Nearly all the land in Nance County was purchased by settlers or by investors for resale, instead of the homestead provisions common to most of Nebraska.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 448 square miles (1,160 km2), of which 442 square miles (1,140 km2) is land and 6.6 square miles (17 km2) (1.5%) is water.
