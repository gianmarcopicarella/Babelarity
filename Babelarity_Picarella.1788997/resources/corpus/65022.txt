In mathematics, an exact differential equation or total differential equation is a certain kind of ordinary differential equation which is widely used in physics and engineering.
Given a simply connected and open subset D of R2 and two functions I and J which are continuous on D then an implicit first-order ordinary differential equation of the form
        I
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
          d
        x
        +
        J
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
          d
        y
        =
        0
        ,
    {\displaystyle I(x,y)\,\mathrm {d} x+J(x,y)\,\mathrm {d} y=0,\,\!}
is called an exact differential equation if there exists a continuously differentiable function F, called the potential function, so that
              ∂
              F
              ∂
              x
        =
        I
    {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial F}{\partial x}}=I}
and
              ∂
              F
              ∂
              y
        =
        J
        .
    {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial F}{\partial y}}=J.}
The nomenclature of "exact differential equation" refers to the exact derivative of a function. For a function 
        F
        (
          x
            0
        ,

            n
        )
    {\displaystyle F(x_{0},x_{1},...,x_{n-1},x_{n})}
  , the exact or total derivative with respect to 
          x
            0
    {\displaystyle x_{0}}
   is given by
                d
              F
                d
                x
                  0
        =
              ∂
              F
              ∂

The function 
        F
        :
            R
            2
        →
          R
    {\displaystyle F:\mathbb {R} ^{2}\to \mathbb {R} }
   given by
        F
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
        =
            1
            2
        (
          x
            2
        +
          y
            2
        )
    {\displaystyle F(x,y)={\frac {1}{2}}(x^{2}+y^{2})}
is a potential function for the differential equation
        x
          d
        x
        +
        y
          d
        y
        =
        0.
    {\displaystyle x\,\mathrm {d} x+y\,\mathrm {d} y=0.\,}
In physical applications the functions I and J are usually not only continuous but even continuously differentiable. Schwarz's Theorem then provides us with a necessary criterion for the existence of a potential function. For differential equations defined on simply connected sets the criterion is even sufficient and we get the following theorem:
Given a differential equation of the form (for example, when F has zero slope in the x and y direction at F(x,y) ):
        I
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
          d
        x
        +
        J
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
          d
        y
        =
        0
        ,
    {\displaystyle I(x,y)\,\mathrm {d} x+J(x,y)\,\mathrm {d} y=0,\,\!}
with I and J continuously differentiable on a simply connected and open subset D of R2 then a potential function F exists if and only if
              ∂
              I
              ∂
              y
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
        =
              ∂
              J
              ∂
              x
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
        .
    {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial I}{\partial y}}(x,y)={\frac {\partial J}{\partial x}}(x,y).}
Given an exact differential equation defined on some simply connected and open subset D of R2 with potential function F then a differentiable function f with (x, f(x)) in D is a solution if and only if there exists real number c so that
        F
        (
        x
        ,
        f
        (
        x
        )
        )
        =
        c
        .
    {\displaystyle F(x,f(x))=c.\,}
For an initial value problem
        y
        (
          x
            0
        )
        =
          y
            0
    {\displaystyle y(x_{0})=y_{0}\,}
we can locally find a potential function by
        F
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
        =
          ∫
              x
                0
            x
        I
        (
        t
        ,
          y
            0
        )
          d
        t
        +
          ∫
              y
                0
            y
          [
          J
          (
          x
          ,
          t
          )
          −
            ∫
                x
                  0
              x
                ∂
                I
                ∂
                t
          (
          u
          ,
          t
          )
            d
          u
          ]
          d
        t
        .
    {\displaystyle F(x,y)=\int _{x_{0}}^{x}I(t,y_{0})\mathrm {d} t+\int _{y_{0}}^{y}\left[J(x,t)-\int _{x_{0}}^{x}{\frac {\partial I}{\partial t}}(u,t)\,\mathrm {d} u\,\right]\mathrm {d} t.}
Solving
        F
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
        =
        c
    {\displaystyle F(x,y)=c\,}
for y, where c is a real number, we can then construct all solutions.
