One of his first notable roles was as a Glasgow schoolboy in Charles Gormley's Heavenly Pursuits (1985). He would also play the lead in the BBC Scotland feature-length adaptation of the William McIlvanney short story "Dreaming" (1990).
Bremner portrayed Spud in Danny Boyle's film adaptation of Irvine Welsh's 1993 novel Trainspotting, and Mullet, a street thug in Guy Ritchie's Snatch. In the 1995 stage version of Trainspotting, Bremner played the lead role of Mark Renton, the role played by Ewan McGregor in the 1996 film. He has played supporting roles in blockbusters such as Pearl Harbor  and Black Hawk Down, in which he appeared alongside Trainspotting costar Ewan McGregor (which he has again since, in Perfect Sense and Jack the Giant Slayer). In 2005, he had a small role in the mini-series Elizabeth I as James VI, King of Scots. In December 2006, he played Harold Stritzke in the Sci Fi Channel miniseries The Lost Room.
