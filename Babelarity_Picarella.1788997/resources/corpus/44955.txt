He made his breakthrough in Sweden in 2000 with the song "Känn ingen sorg för mig Göteborg" and a similarly titled album. He has released 8 studio albums to date with seven reaching number 1 in Sverigetopplistan, the official Swedish Albums Chart and one reaching number 2.
Hellström played drums in the Swedish indie pop band Broder Daniel between 1988 and 1994, then briefly for Swedish alternative rock band Honey Is Cool with Karin from The Knife.

In 2006, following the birth of his son, he announced that he would take a break from touring and recording. Despite this, he still performed occasional gigs and continues to release very successful albums.
