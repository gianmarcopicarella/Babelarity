The current national emblem of Sudan was adopted in 1985. It shows a secretary bird bearing a shield from the time of Muhammad Ahmad, the self-proclaimed Mahdi who briefly ruled Sudan in the 19th century.
Two scrolls are placed on the arms; the upper one displays the national motto, An-nasr lanā النصر لنا ("Victory is ours"), and the lower one displays the title of the state, جمهورية السودان Jumhūriyat as-Sūdān ("Republic of the Sudan").
The coat of arms is also the Presidential seal and is found in gold on the flag of the President of Sudan and on the vehicles carrying the President and at his residence.
The secretary bird was chosen as a distinctively Sudanese and indigenous variant of the "Eagle of Saladin" and "Hawk of Quraish" seen in the emblems of some Arab states, and associated with Arab nationalism (see Coat of arms of Egypt, etc.).
The former state emblem was in use from independence in 1956 to 1970, when the current emblem was adopted. It consisted of a rhinoceros enclosed by two palm-trees and olive branches, with the name of the state, جمهورية السودان Jumhūriyat as-Sūdān ("Republic of the Sudan"), displayed below.
