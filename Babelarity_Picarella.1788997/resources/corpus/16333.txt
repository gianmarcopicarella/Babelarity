San Marino Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Serravalle, San Marino. First opened in 1969, it is currently used mostly for football matches. It is the national stadium of San Marino, and is also used by the club San Marino Calcio, which plays in the Italian football league.
The Stadio Olimpico was also used by Serravalle-based football club A.C. Juvenes/Dogana for its home games in the Italian league, until the side withdrew to concentrate only on the Sanmarinese Championship. The Stadio Olimpico is an all-seater stadium and has a maximum capacity of 6,664. It has hosted teams such as England, Spain, Germany, and the Netherlands.
The San Marino national team's three biggest defeats in the stadium are a record 13–0 to Germany in September 2006 and more recently 8–0 to England and by the same score against Ukraine, both in 2013. The national team's only win was also in this stadium; a friendly 1–0 beating of Liechtenstein in 2004. This stadium seats are in two stands along the lengths of the pitch and the highest ever capacities are in those same matches against Germany and England. 5,019 people saw them lose to Germany, and 4,952 saw them lose to England.
San Marino's first official international match was a 4–0 defeat to Switzerland, which was also played here.
It is also home to the youth teams of San Marino, some of which have worse records on the international stage than the senior team; though their Under-21 side did record a shock 1–0 win over their Welsh counterparts in 2013.
In 2014, the San Marino team gained their first ever European Championship qualification point here, in a 0-0 draw with Estonia.
The final of the San Marino domestic cup is also played here each year.
