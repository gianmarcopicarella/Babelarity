Georges Speicher (pronounced: [ʒɔʁʒ spɛ.ʃe]; 8 June 1907 – 24 January 1978) was a French cyclist who won the 1933 Tour de France along with three stage wins, and the 1933 World Cycling Championship.
After Speicher had won the 1933 Tour de France, he was initially not selected for the 1933 UCI Road World Championships. Only after a French cyclist that had been selected dropped out, Speicher was brought in as a replacement at the last notice, and won the race. Speicher was the first cyclist to win the Tour de France and the World Championship in the same year.
