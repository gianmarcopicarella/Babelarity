The United States presidential election of 2016, constitutionally prescribed to occur on Tuesday, November 8, 2016, will be the 58th quadrennial U.S. presidential election. Voters will select presidential electors who in turn will elect a new president and vice president through the Electoral College. The term limit established in the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution prevents the incumbent president, Barack Obama of the Democratic Party, from being elected to a third term. If President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden serve out the remainder of their respective terms, the 2016 election will determine the 45th President and 48th Vice President of the United States.
The series of presidential primary elections and caucuses took place between February 1 and June 14, 2016, staggered among the 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories. This nominating process is also an indirect election, where voters cast ballots for a slate of delegates to a political party's nominating convention, who in turn elect their party's presidential nominee. The 2016 Republican National Convention will take place from July 18–21, 2016 in Cleveland, Ohio, while the 2016 Democratic National Convention will take place from July 25–28, 2016 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Businessman and reality television personality Donald Trump became the Republican Party's presidential nominee on July 19, 2016, after defeating Senator Ted Cruz, Governor John Kasich, Senator Marco Rubio and several other candidates in the Republican primary elections. Former Secretary of State and New York Senator Hillary Clinton became the Democratic Party's presumptive presidential nominee on June 6, 2016. Clinton's main rival for the Democratic nomination, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, has stated he will assist in efforts to defeat Trump and officially endorsed Clinton on July 12, but has yet to formally suspend his campaign.
Various third party and independent presidential candidates will also contest the election, of which two have currently obtained enough ballot access to win the presidency and have been featured in major national polls: the Libertarian Party nominee, former Governor of New Mexico Gary Johnson; and the Green Party presumptive nominee Jill Stein. Both Johnson and Stein ran as their parties' presidential nominees in the 2012 election.
Article Two of the United States Constitution provides that the President and Vice President of the United States must be natural-born citizens of the United States at least 35 years old, and a resident of the United States for a period of at least 14 years. Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the political parties of the United States, in which case each party devises a method (such as a primary election) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. The primary elections are usually indirect elections where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The general election in November is also an indirect election, where voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the Electoral College; these electors in turn directly elect the President and Vice President.
Obama, a Democrat and former U.S. Senator from Illinois, is ineligible to seek reelection to a third term due to restrictions of the Twenty-second Amendment; in accordance with Section I of the Twentieth Amendment, his term expires at 12:00 noon on January 20, 2017.
In the 2008 election, Obama was elected president, defeating the Republican nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, with 52.9% of the popular vote and 68% of the electoral vote, succeeding two-term Republican President George W. Bush, the former Governor of Texas. Since the end of 2009, Obama's first year in office, polling companies such as Gallup have found Obama's approval ratings to be between 40-50%. Analysts such as Larry Sabato have noted that Obama's approval ratings could impact the 2016 campaign, either helping or hurting Clinton.
In the 2010 midterm elections, the Democratic Party suffered significant losses in Congress; the Republicans gained 63 seats in the House of Representatives – taking back control of the chamber in the process – and six seats in the Senate, though short of achieving a majority. As a result of the Republicans' recapture of the House after losing it to the Democrats in the 2006 midterm elections, John Boehner became the 53rd Speaker of the House of Representatives, making Obama the first President in 16 years to lose the House of Representatives in the first half of his first term in an election that was characterized by the economy's slow recovery, and the rise of the Tea Party movement.
In the 2012 presidential election, Obama defeated former Governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney with 51.1% of the popular vote and 61.7% of the electoral vote, extending his already historic presidency in the process. Meanwhile, despite minor losses, Republicans retained their majority of seats in the House of Representatives while Democrats increased their majority in the Senate.
Speculation about the 2016 campaign began almost immediately following the 2012 campaign, with New York magazine declaring the race had begun in an article published on November 8, two days after the 2012 election. On the same day, Politico released an article predicting the 2016 general election may be between Clinton and former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush, while a New York Times article named Governor of New Jersey Chris Christie and New Jersey Senator Cory Booker as potential candidates.
In the 2014 midterm elections, voter turnout was the lowest since 1942 with only 36.4% of eligible voters voting. As a result, not only had the Republicans retained control of the House of Representatives, increasing their majority to its largest level since March 4, 1929, but also gained a majority in the Senate.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who also served in the U.S. Senate and was the First Lady of the United States, became the first Democrat to announce a major candidacy for the presidency. Clinton made the announcement on April 12, 2015 via a video message. While Nationwide opinion polls in 2015 indicated that Clinton is the front-runner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, she faces challenges from Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who became the second candidate when he made a formal announcement on April 30, 2015 that he was running for the Democratic nomination. September 2015 polling numbers indicated a narrowing gap between Clinton and Sanders. On May 30, 2015, former Governor of Maryland Martin O'Malley was the third candidate to enter the race. Four days later, on June 3, 2015, Lincoln Chafee, former Independent Governor and Republican Senator of Rhode Island, became the fourth Democrat to announce his candidacy. On July 2, 2015, former Virginia Senator Jim Webb became the fifth Democrat to announce his candidacy. On September 6, 2015, former Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig became the sixth and final Democrat to announce his candidacy.
On October 20, 2015, Webb announced his withdrawal from the Democratic primaries, and explored a potential Independent run. The next day, Joseph Biden, the incumbent Vice President and former U.S. Senator from Delaware, opted not to run, ending months of speculation, stating, "While I will not be a candidate, I will not be silent." Two days later, on October 23, 2015, Chafee withdrew, stating that he hoped for "an end to the endless wars and the beginning of a new era for the United States and humanity." On November 2, 2015, after failing to qualify for the second officially-sanctioned DNC debate after adoption of a rule change negated polls which before might have necessitated his inclusion in said debate, Lessig withdrew as well, narrowing the field to Clinton, O'Malley, and Sanders heading into the Iowa Caucus.
On February 1, 2016, in an extremely close contest, Clinton won the Iowa caucuses by a margin of 0.2% over Sanders. Winning no delegates in the contest, O'Malley withdrew from the presidential race that day. On February 9, 2016, Sanders bounced back to win the New Hampshire primary with 60% of the vote. In the remaining two February contests, Clinton won the Nevada caucuses with 53% of the vote and scored a decisive victory in the South Carolina primary with 73% of the vote.
On March 1, 2016, 11 states participated in the first of four "Super Tuesday" primaries, with Clinton winning Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia for a total of 504 pledged delegates, while Sanders won Colorado, Minnesota, Oklahoma and his home state of Vermont to garner a total of 340 delegates by the end of the night. On the weekend of March 5, 2016, Sanders racked up victories in Kansas, Nebraska and Maine with 15- to 30-point margins, while Clinton won the Louisiana primary with 71% of the vote. On March 8, 2016, despite never having a lead in the Michigan primary, Sanders scored a stunning upset, winning by a small margin of 1.5% and outperforming polls by over 19 points, while, as expected, Clinton won 83% of the vote in Mississippi. On March 15, 2016, the second of four "Super Tuesday" primaries, Clinton won Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio. Between March 22 and April 9, 2016, Sanders won six caucuses in Idaho, Utah, Alaska, Hawaii, Washington and Wyoming, as well as the Wisconsin primary, while Clinton won the Arizona primary. By this stage, Clinton had won 1,305 pledged delegates to Sanders' 1,099.
On April 19, 2016, Clinton won the New York primary with 58% of the vote. On April 26, 2016, in the third of four "Super Tuesday" primaries dubbed the "Acela primary," she won contests in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland and Pennsylvania while Sanders won Rhode Island. On May 3, 2016, Sanders pulled off another surprise win in the Indiana primary with a 5-point margin of victory and he proceeded to claim West Virginia on May 10, 2016 with a 15-point lead, while Clinton won the Guam caucus on May 7, 2016.
As of May 10, 2016, of the 78% of pledged delegates allocated in primaries and caucuses so far, Clinton has won 54% to Sanders' 46%. Out of the 714 unpledged delegates or "superdelegates" who will vote in the convention in July, Clinton has received endorsements from 505 (71%), while Sanders has received 41 (6%).
On June 6, 2016, the Associated Press and NBC News stated that Clinton had become the presumptive nominee after reaching the required number of delegates, including both pledged and unpledged delegates (superdelegates), to secure the nomination, becoming the first woman to ever clinch the nomination of any major political party in the United States in the process. On June 7, 2016, Clinton officially secured a majority of pledged delegates after winning in the California and New Jersey primaries. She won the final primary in Washington, D.C. on June 14, 2016. Sanders has not officially dropped out of the race, but announced on June 16, 2016 that his main goal in the coming months would be to work with Clinton to defeat Trump in the general election. On July 12, 2016 Sanders formally endorsed Clinton at a rally in New Hampshire in which he appeared with Clinton.

A total of 17 major candidates entered the race starting March 23, 2015, when Senator Ted Cruz of Texas was the first to formally announce his candidacy: former Governor Jeb Bush of Florida, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson of Maryland, Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey, businesswoman Carly Fiorina of California, former Governor Jim Gilmore of Virginia, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, former Governor Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, former Governor Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Governor John Kasich of Ohio, former Governor George Pataki of New York, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, former Governor Rick Perry of Texas, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, businessman Donald Trump of New York and Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin. This was the largest presidential primary field for any political party in American history.
Prior to the Iowa caucuses on February 1, 2016, Perry, Walker, Jindal, Graham and Pataki withdrew due to low polling numbers. Despite leading many polls in Iowa, Trump came in second to Cruz, after which Huckabee, Paul and Santorum withdrew due to poor performances at the ballot box. Following a sizable victory for Trump in the New Hampshire primary, Christie, Fiorina and Gilmore abandoned the race. Bush followed suit after scoring fourth place to Trump, Rubio and Cruz in South Carolina. On March 1, 2016, the first of four "Super Tuesday" primaries, Rubio won his first contest in Minnesota, Cruz won Alaska, Oklahoma and his home of Texas and Trump won the other seven states that voted. Failing to gain traction, Carson suspended his campaign a few days later. On March 15, 2016, the second of four "Super Tuesday" primaries, Kasich won his only contest in his home state of Ohio and Trump won five primaries including Florida. Rubio suspended his campaign after losing his home state, but retained a large share of his delegates for the national convention, which he plans to release to Trump.
Between March 16 and May 3, 2016, only three candidates remained in the race: Trump, Cruz and Kasich. Cruz won most delegates in four Western contests and in Wisconsin, keeping a credible path to denying Trump the nomination on first ballot with 1,237 delegates. However, Trump scored landslide victories in New York and five Northeastern states in April and he grabbed all 57 delegates in the Indiana primary of May 3, 2016. Without any further chances of forcing a contested convention, both Cruz and Kasich suspended their campaigns. Trump remained the only active candidate and was declared the presumptive Republican nominee by Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus on the evening of May 3, 2016.

Donald Trump turned his attention towards selecting a running mate after he became the presumptive nominee on May 4, 2016. In mid-June, Eli Stokols and Burgess Everett of Politico reported that the Trump campaign was considering New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich of Georgia, Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions, and Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin. A June 30 Washington Post report also included Senators Bob Corker of Tennessee, Richard Burr of North Carolina, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, and Joni Ernst of Iowa, as well as Indiana Governor Mike Pence as individuals still being considered for the ticket. Trump also stated that he was considering two military generals for the position, including retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn.
In July 2016, it was reported that Trump had narrowed his list of possible running mates down to the following three individuals.
Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey, a former 2016 presidential candidate
Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich of Georgia, a 2012 presidential candidate
Governor Mike Pence of Indiana, a former chairman of the House Republican Conference
On July 14, 2016, several major media outlets reported that Trump had selected Pence as his running mate. Trump confirmed these reports in a message on Twitter on July 15, 2016 and made the formal announcement the following day in New York.

In every state except Maine and Nebraska, the winner of the popular vote in the state wins all of the electoral votes of the state. However, state legislatures can, by law, change how electors are elected. Maine and Nebraska use the "congressional district method", in which the winner of the state receives two electoral votes and candidates receive additional electoral votes for each congressional district that they win. Recent presidential campaigns have generally focused their resources on a relatively small number of competitive states.
The battleground states for this election are Nevada, Colorado, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Virginia, North Carolina, Minnesota and Florida. Other Democratic targets may include Nebraska's second congressional district, Montana, Missouri, Indiana, Georgia, and Arizona. Trump's relatively poor polling in Utah has raised the possibility that it could become a competitive state, despite easy wins by recent Republican presidential candidates in the state. However, multiple analysts have recently asserted that it is not yet a viable Democratic destination. Meanwhile, Republicans may target Maine's second congressional district, New Mexico, and Oregon. Other states may also become competitive if the close races of 2016 differ from the close races of the 2012 election, or if 2016 becomes a landslide election.
Several sites and individuals publish periodic electoral predictions. These projections generally rate the race by the probability that either of the two parties wins each state. The term "tossup" is generally used to indicate that neither party has an advantage, "lean" to indicate that one party has a slight edge, "likely" to indicate that one party has a clear advantage, and "safe" to indicate that one party is heavily favored. All states classified without a rating of "safe" from any of the Cook Political Report, Sabato's Crystal Ball, or the Rothenberg-Gonzales Political Report are included in the table below. The state's Cook PVI and the latest swing for each state are also listed, as well as competitive congressional districts in Maine and Nebraska.

This is an overview of the money used in the campaign as it is reported to Federal Election Commission (FEC) and released in June 2016. Outside groups are independent expenditure only committees - also called PACs and SuperPACs. Several such groups normally support each candidate, but the numbers in the table are a total of all of them. This means that a group of committees can be shown as technically insolvent (shown in red) even though it is not the case of all of them. The Campaign Committee's debt are shown in red if the campaign is technically insolvent. The source of all the numbers is Center for Responsive Politics. Some spending totals are not available, due to withdrawals before the FEC deadline.
The Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), a non-profit organization controlled by the Republican and Democratic parties, plans to host debates between qualifying presidential and vice-presidential candidates. According to the commission's website, to be eligible to opt to participate in the anticipated debates, "... in addition to being Constitutionally eligible, candidates must appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to have a mathematical chance of winning a majority vote in the Electoral College, and have a level of support of at least 15 percent of the national electorate as determined by five selected national public opinion polling organizations, using the average of those organizations' most recently publicly-reported results at the time of the determination." The three locations chosen to host the presidential debates, and the one location selected to host the vice presidential debate, were announced on September 23, 2015. The site of the first debate was originally designated as Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio; however, due to rising costs and security concerns, the debate was moved to Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York.  However, as the time nears the party conventions, the campaign of the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump, has not yet committed to participate in the debates, which have become a staple of presidential election cycles for over a half-century.
The Free & Equal Elections Foundation plan to host an open debate among all presidential candidates who have ballot access sufficient to represent a majority of electoral votes. It is to be held at the University of Colorado Boulder's Macky Auditorium on October 25, 2016. As of May 2016, the nominees of the Democratic, Republican, Libertarian, and Green parties qualify for this debate.
