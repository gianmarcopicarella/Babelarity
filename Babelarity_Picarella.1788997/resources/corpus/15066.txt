Markel Susaeta Laskurain (Basque: [markel s̻us̻aeta las̻kuɾain], Spanish: [ˈmarkel susaˈeta laskuˈɾain]; born 14 December 1987) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for Athletic Bilbao as a right winger.
Coming through the ranks of Athletic Bilbao, Susaeta was born in Eibar, Gipuzkoa, being given his first-team debut on 2 September 2007 and managing to score in a 1–3 loss at FC Barcelona. At the start of the 2007–08 season, he was also registered for the B-side, but finished it with 29 La Liga appearances (netting on four occasions).
In the following years, Susaeta established himself firmly in Athletic's first team, although still not an undisputed starter for the Basque side. On 31 January 2009, he scored four minutes from time to give his team a 3–2 home win against Málaga CF, in an eventual narrow escape from relegation; he also appeared in six matches in the campaign's Copa del Rey, as Athletic reached the final against Barcelona.
Susaeta netted a career-best 13 official goals in 2011–12, including five in the season's UEFA Europa League as Athletic reached the final –the Lions also reached the decisive match in the domestic cup, once again against Barcelona.
On 9 November 2012, following a series of good displays, Susaeta was called up to the Spanish national team for the first time, being selected by manager Vicente del Bosque for a friendly against Panama on the 14th and scoring the final goal in the 5–1 win in Panama City.
