Anemone hupehensis, Anemone hupehensis var. japonica, and Anemone × hybrida (commonly known as the Chinese anemone or Japanese anemone, thimbleweed, or windflower) are species of flowering herbaceous perennials in the Ranunculaceae family.
Anemone × hybrida Paxton is a hybrid of Anemone hupehensis var. japonica and Anemone vitifolia. It should not be confused with Anemone hybrida Miq. ex Pritz., a synonym of Anemone halleri All.
Height is 3–4 ft (1–1 m). Leaves have three leaflets.
Flowers are 40–60 mm (1.6–2.4 in) across, with 5-6 (or up to 20 in double forms) sculpted pink or white sepals and prominent yellow stamens, blooming from midsummer to autumn.
These plants thrive best in shady areas and under protection of larger plants, and in all but the hottest and the driest conditions in the United States. They are especially sensitive to drought or overwatering. They can be invasive or weedy in some areas, throwing out suckers from the fibrous rootstock, to rapidly colonise an area. Once established they can be extremely difficult to eradicate. On the other hand, they can take some time to become established.
The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:
A. hupehensis is native to central China, though it has been naturalised in Japan for hundreds of years.
The species was first named and described in Flora Japonica (1784), by Carl Thunberg. Thunberg had collected dried specimens while working as a doctor for the Dutch East Indies Company. In 1844, Robert Fortune brought the plant to England from China, where he found it often planted about graves.
