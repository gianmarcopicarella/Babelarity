The city owes its beginnings to the coming of the railroad to Goiás. The railroad company proposed the construction of a railroad station in the region if the lands were made available to start a community. Coronel Lino Teixeira Sampaio, one of the founders of the town, the other one being Balduino Ernesto de Almeida,donated lands from his ranch to build the first houses. An area was reserved for the town and a plan was drawn up. This was never carried out since the residents built their houses outside the area. In 1922 a metal bridge was built over the Rio Corumbá and the settlement began to grow attracting residents from nearby areas. The name, Pires do Rio, was given to the train station and then to the town, in honor of the Minister of Transportation and Public Works of Brazil José Pires do Rio. Source: Sepin.
