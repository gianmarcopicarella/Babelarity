Symphonic rock is a subgenre of rock music.
King Crimson are generally credited as the first global standard-bearers of symphonic rock. They were preceded by some artists in the late 1960s who had their own chart successes, such as the songs "Nights in White Satin" (The Moody Blues, 1967) and "A Whiter Shade of Pale" (Procol Harum, 1967).
Interest in symphonic prog flowered again, starting with Echolyn's eponymous first album in 1991.
