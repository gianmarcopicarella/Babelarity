Murfreesboro is a city and county seat of Pike County, Arkansas, United States. Its population was 1,764 at the 2000 census. The city is known for the Crater of Diamonds State Park located south of the city. It is also dry meaning no alcohol.
In 1906, diamonds were found on a local farm. It was determined that an 80-acre (32 ha) volcanic formation was the source of the diamonds. The property was eventually sold to the state of Arkansas, which opened the 911-acre (369 ha) Crater of Diamonds State Park to the public. A daily fee ($8 in 2015) is charged to search for Diamonds.
Also located in Murfreesboro is the 1,000-year-old Ka-Do-Ha Indian Village and museum, which offers a field that can be excavated for authentic arrowheads.
