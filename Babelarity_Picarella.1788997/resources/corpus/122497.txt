Gje (Ѓ ѓ; italics: Ѓ ѓ) is a letter of the Cyrillic script.
Ѓ is used in Macedonian to represent the voiced palatal plosive /ɟ/ or the voiced alveolo-palatal affricate /dʑ/, similar to the pronunciation of 〈j〉 in "jet".
Ѓ is most commonly romanized using the Latin letter G with acute 〈ǵ〉. When the Socialist Republic of Macedonia was part of SFR Yugoslavia, the Macedonian ѓ was also transliterated as đ or dj.
Words with this letter are often cognate with жд - zhd in Bulgarian and Dje (Ђ ђ) in Serbo-Croatian. For example, the Macedonian word for birth (раѓање is raǵanje, which in Bulgarian is раждане - razhdane, and in Serbian рађање - rađanje).
