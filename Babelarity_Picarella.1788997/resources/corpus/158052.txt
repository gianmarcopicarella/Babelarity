Drackenstein is a municipality in the district of Göppingen in Baden-Württemberg in southern Germany.
Unterdrackenstein is located at the beginning of Gosbach valley on a Kalksinterterrasse. Drackenstein is located on the slope between the Gosbach valley and the plateau of the Swabian Alb, about 25 km from the district town of Göppingen away. From Unterdrackenstein a waterfall plunging foes into the valley of Gos. Near the waterfall is the Grotto, a several meters deep cave. On the plateau of the Swabian Alb, (karst mountains), in earlier times water was a precious commodity. Therefore there was in Unterdrackenstein a hydraulic ram, that pumped water to Oberdrackenstein. By connecting to the Lake Constance Water Supply in the 20th century these problems belong to the past. At the opposite Drackensteiner overhang the road runs Federal Highway 8 towards Stuttgart. There stood the dragon hole, a cavity, which was filled in during the construction of the motorway. It is believed that the name of the community goes back to a legend of the dragon hole.
