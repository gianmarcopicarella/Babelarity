Racing Club Ferrol is a Spanish football team based in Ferrol, Province of A Coruña, in the autonomous community of Galicia.
Founded in 1919 in currently plays in Segunda División B – Group 1, holding home games at Estadio da Malata. Club colours are green shirts with white shorts, though during the early years of its existence green and white shirts with vertical stripes were used.
The history of football in Ferrol is associated with the shipbuilding yards, workshops, foundries and drydocks and the British technical advisors, hired to work locally who used to play against existing teams. During the late 19th century and early 20th century there were different football teams organized in Ferrol, though only one of them has survived, and as a result of an amalgamation of some other previous teams.
Racing Ferrol Football Club traced its origins back to July 1919, first competing in national championships ten years later and fluctuating in the following decades between the second – first presence in 1939–40 – and third divisions. In 1977–78 the Galicians won the inaugural edition of Segunda División B and promoted again, only to be immediately relegated back.
It would not until the year 2000 that Racing would again reach the second level, going on to spend there five of the following six years. In the 2006–07 campaign the club gained promotion to the category in the playoffs, with a 2–1 aggregate win against Alicante CF. In the following season the team finished fourth from the bottom and dropped back to the third division, and to the fourth only two years later.

Estadio da Malata holds 12,043 spectators, and was built in 1993. The pitch dimensions are 105 x 68 metres.
Racing used three main stadiums over the years, starting with Campo de Futbol O Inferniño, which was utilized until a move to Estadio Manuel Rivera in 1954 took place. This was an oval-shaped enclosure with a single cantilever stand. In the 1970s, a cover was erected over the popular terrace.
In 1993, the metropolitan area of Ferrol built Estadio da Malata to the west of the town, near the valley of Serantes. The total cost of the development was 1700 million pesetas. The first match on the new grounds was played on 18 April 1993, in a 3–2 friendly win over Atlético Madrid B. The official inauguration took place on 29 August, in a triangular tournament featuring the home side and neighbours Celta de Vigo and Deportivo de La Coruña.
