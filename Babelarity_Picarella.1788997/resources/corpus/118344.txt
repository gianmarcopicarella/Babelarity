Narvi (/ˈnɑːrvi/ NAR-vee), or Saturn XXXI (31), is a natural satellite of Saturn. It was discovered by a team of astronomers led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2003, and given the temporary designation S/2003 S 1.
Narvi is about 7 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Saturn at an average distance of 19,371,000 km in 1006.541 days, at an inclination of 137° to the ecliptic (109° to Saturn's equator), in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.320.
It was named in January 2005 after Narfi, a giant in Norse mythology. The name was approved by the IAU Working Group on Planetary System Nomenclature on 21 January 2005.
