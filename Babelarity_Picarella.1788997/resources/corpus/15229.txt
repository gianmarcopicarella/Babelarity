The 1983 Belgian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Spa-Francorchamps on May 22, 1983. After 13 years, the F1 circus returned to Spa after the track had been shortened. This was the first F1 race to be held on the modern Spa circuit.
Andrea de Cesaris, who won both the original and the second starts and led for the first third of the race before his Alfa Romeo's engine expired, scored his only career fastest lap.
Note: Only the top five positions are included for both sets of standings.
