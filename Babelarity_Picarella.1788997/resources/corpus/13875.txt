Giuseppe Casari (10 April 1922 âˆ’ 12 November 2013) was an Italian football (soccer) player.
Born and raised in Martinengo, Bergamo he debuted for his local Atalanta in the 1944 regional championship and in Serie A the following year. In 1948 he was the starting goalkeeper for the national team at the London Olympics but, following a clean sheet against the United States, he conceded five goals against Denmark. He was part of the 1950 World Cup team as a reserve behind Sentimenti IV but in the game against Paraguay Giuseppe Moro was called upon instead. After the World Cup he went to Napoli where he earned four caps for the national team, although he never secured a permanent starting position (the national team had called up 12 goalkeepers in a matter of 15 years). He did, however, figure in the 1950 World Cup, and was at their 3-2 loss to Sweden.
