Dorothy Anne Todd (24 January 1909 – 6 May 1993) was an English actress and producer.
Todd was born in Hartford, Cheshire, England, and educated at St. Winifrid's School, Eastbourne, Sussex.
Todd became a popular actress by appearing in such films as Perfect Strangers (1945) (as a nurse) and The Seventh Veil (1945) (as a troubled concert pianist). She is perhaps best known to American audiences as Gregory Peck's long-suffering wife in Alfred Hitchcock's The Paradine Case (1947).
In 1946, Todd was said to be the "holder of the most lucrative contract ever signed by an English cinema actress, with over a million dollars involved in its clauses."
Todd starred in two episodes of Playhouse 90: Not the Glory and The Grey Nurse Said Nothing.
In 1957, Todd starred in the Broadway production of Four Winds.
She later produced a series of travel films. Her autobiography is entitled The Eighth Veil, an allusion to the film which made her a star in Britain. Todd was known as the "pocket Garbo" for her diminutive, blonde beauty.
Todd said of herself, "I'm really very shy, and I get over that playing an actress."
Todd married three times. Her first husband, Victor N. Malcolm, was a grandson of Lillie Langtry and Prince Louis of Battenberg, the 1st Marquess of Milford Haven; she had a son with him named David Malcolm. Her second and third husbands (Nigel Tangye and David Lean) were first cousins. She had a daughter with Nigel Tangye called Ann Francesca Tangye. She was divorced from Tangye 12 March 1949.
Todd married film director Lean on 21 May 1949 and starred in a number of his films, including The Passionate Friends (1949), Madeleine (1950) and The Sound Barrier (1952). Lean and Todd divorced 15 July 1957.
Todd died on 6 May 1993 from a stroke aged 84.
