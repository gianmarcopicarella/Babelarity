Five Finger Death Punch has been described as groove metal, thrash metal, alternative metal and hard rock. Thom Jurek of AllMusic wrote that Five Finger Death Punch's "instantly recognizable sound is comprised of equal parts melodic and meaty guitar riffs, fat vamps, catchy hooks, tight, flashy solos, and hard-grooving bass and drums". Five Finger Death Punch vocalist Ivan Moody's vocals are usually singing and screaming. Five Finger Death Punch also occasionally play ballads.
Bathory described Five Finger Death Punch as "a straight-up heavy metal band with a hint of thrash metal — maybe a hint of the Euro stuff in there" and then said, "that's pretty much what we are". Spencer described Five Finger Death Punch as "kind of like stepping on a garden rake while looking at a supermodel. Blissful yet fucking devastating". He then said, "We have an energy and a rhythmical style that's different than what's happening out there. We have songs that grab you and stay with you and rip your face off. Hooks, balls, melodies and energy — that's us".
Five Finger Death Punch guitarist Zoltan Bathory cited Pantera as an influence. Ivan Moody cited vocalists such as Mike Patton, Phil Anselmo, Layne Staley and Lynn Strait as influences. Moody also said, "Pantera is one of our biggest influences". Jeremy Spencer cited drummers such as Lars Ulrich, Dave Lombardo, Gene Hoglan, Dave Grohl, Buddy Rich and Tommy Aldridge as influences.
