Huntington Park is a city in the Gateway Cities district of southeastern Los Angeles County, California.
As of the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 58,114, down from 61,348 at the 2000 census.
Named for prominent industrialist Henry E. Huntington, Huntington Park was incorporated in 1906 as a streetcar suburb for workers in the rapidly expanding industries to the southeast of downtown Los Angeles. To this day, about 30% of its residents work at factories in nearby Vernon and Commerce. The stretch of Pacific Boulevard in downtown Huntington Park was a major commercial district serving the city's largely working-class residents, as well as those of neighboring cities such as Bell, Cudahy, South Gate, and Downey. As with most of the other cities along the corridor stretching along the Los Angeles River to the south and southeast of downtown Los Angeles, Huntington Park was an almost exclusively white community during most of its history; Alameda Street and Slauson Avenue, which were fiercely defended segregation lines in the 1950s, separated it from black areas.
The changes that shaped Los Angeles from the late 1970s onward—the decline of American manufacturing that began in the 1970s; the rapid growth of newer suburbs in Orange County, the eastern San Gabriel, western San Fernando and Conejo valleys; the collapse of the aerospace and defense industry at the end of the Cold War; and the implosion of the Southern California real estate boom in the early 1990s—resulted in the wholesale departure of virtually all of the white population of Huntington Park by the mid-1990s. The vacuum was filled almost entirely by two groups of Latinos: upwardly mobile families eager to leave the barrios of East Los Angeles, and recent Mexican immigrants. Today, Pacific Boulevard is once again a thriving commercial strip, serving as a major retail center for working-class residents of southeastern Los Angeles County—but unlike its previous heyday of the 1930s, the signs along the avenue's storefronts are now primarily in Spanish.
A weekly certified farmers market is now hosted at Salt Lake Park (opposite the Recreation Center on Bissell Street) every Wednesday from 9am-1:30pm. The market includes year round as well as seasonal vendors that provide access to the following products: Bee products, eggs, fruits and fruit products, herbs, nuts, plants, vegetables, granola, nuts, corn, etc.
On November 18, 1930, the Warner's Theater at 6714 Pacific Boulevard, opened and its first attraction was "The Life of the Party". It had 1,468 seats. This theater has been closed for decades. It was bought by Pacific Boulevard Holdings/ Retail Management Corp for $1,600,000. California Theatre opened on 1925 and was operated by Fox Theatres as the Fox California Theatre. In the 80s it was known as the California 3 Theatre. This theatre close in 2006 and was later converted into a retail space. It was renamed California 2 Theatres and now there is a Tuxedo shop along with other retail stores and restaurants.
During the 2014 World Cup, Mexico won the game between Croatia to move on to the next round and Pacific Boulevard was closed down because people filled the streets celebrating. All retail stores and restaurants were told to close. The cops were in riot gear and on horseback to keep the residents safe and making sure no damage was made. Five people were arrested at the moment.
