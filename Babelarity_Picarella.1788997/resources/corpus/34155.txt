The Cleomaceae are a small family of flowering plants in the order Brassicales, comprising about 300 species in 10 genera, or about 150 species in 17 genera. These genera were previously included in the family Capparaceae, but were raised to a distinct family when DNA evidence suggested the genera included in it are more closely related to the Brassicaceae than they are to the Capparaceae. The APG II system allows for Cleomaceae to be included in Brassicaceae.
Their leaves are palmately compound, and they have six stamens.
The genera in Cleomaceae include:
Cleome
Cleomella
Dactylaena
Haptocarpum
Oxystylis
Podandrogyne
Polanisia
Wislizenia
Recent DNA studies have failed to separate Cleome, Podandrogyne, and Polanisia from each other, so some taxonomists have abandoned the last two of these genera, treating them as part of Cleome sensu lato.
