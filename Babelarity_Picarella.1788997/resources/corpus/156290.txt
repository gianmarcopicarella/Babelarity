Montemaggiore Belsito (Sicilian: Muntimaiuri) is a small town and comune located about 50 kilometres (31 mi) southeast of Palermo, Sicily, in the Province of Palermo.
Slightly damaged by several earthquakes, there are several churches and a palace. It is about 517 metres (1,696 ft) above sea level. The village is crossed by a main road that links many others villages (Alia, Aliminusa, Cerda) to Highways A19 and A20. A northern portion of the road is still used for the Targa Florio, one of the oldest car races, and now a rally course.
