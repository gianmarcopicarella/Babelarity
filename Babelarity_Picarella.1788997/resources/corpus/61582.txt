Karymsky (Russian: Карымская сопка, Karymskaya sopka) is an active stratovolcano on the Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia. It is the most active volcano on the Kamchatka Peninsula, as well as the most active volcano of Kamchatka's eastern volcanic zone, a symmetrical stratovolcano constructed within a 5-km-wide caldera that formed during the early Holocene. Much of the cone is mantled by lava flows less than 200 years old. Historical eruptions have been vulcanian or vulcanian-strombolian with moderate explosive activity and occasional lava flows from the summit crater. There is currently an ongoing non-stop eruption occurring, and is the peninsula's most reliable volcano, which has been erupting continuously since 1996.
It is named after Karyms, an ethnic group in Russia.
Past eruption dates are: 1771, 1830, 1852, 1854, 1908, 1911, 1912, 1915, 1921, 1923, 1925, 1929, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1938, 1940, 1943, 1945, 1946, 1947, 1952, 1953, 1955, 1956, 1960, 1965, 1967, 1970, 1982, 1983, 1985, 1990, 1993, 1996, 2004–05, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016.
