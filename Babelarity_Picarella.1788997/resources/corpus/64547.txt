In mathematics, in the field of functional analysis, a Minkowski functional is a function that recovers a notion of distance on a linear space.
Let K be a symmetric (i.e. if it contains x it also contains -x) convex body in a linear space V. We define a function p on V as
        p
        (
        x
        )
        =
        inf
        {
        λ
        ∈
            R
            >
            0
        :
        x
        ∈
        λ
        K
        }
    {\displaystyle p(x)=\inf\{\lambda \in \mathbb {R} _{>0}:x\in \lambda K\}}
This is the Minkowski functional of K. Usually it is assumed that K is such that the set of 
        λ
    {\displaystyle \lambda }
   is never empty, but sometimes the set is allowed to be empty and then p(x) is defined as infinity.
Consider a normed vector space X, with the norm ||·||. Let K be the unit ball in X. Define a function p : X → R by
        p
        (
        x
        )
        =
        inf
          {
          r
          >
          0
          :
          x
          ∈
          r
          K
          }
        .
    {\displaystyle p(x)=\inf \left\{r>0:x\in rK\right\}.}
One can see that 
        p
        (
        x
        )
        =
        ∥
        x
        ∥
    {\displaystyle p(x)=\|x\|}
  , i.e. p is just the norm on X. The function p is a special case of a Minkowski functional.
Let X be a vector space without topology with underlying scalar field K. Take φ ∈ X' , the algebraic dual of X, i.e. φ : X → K is a linear functional on X. Fix a > 0. Let the set K be given by
        K
        =
        {
        x
        ∈
        X
        :
          |
        ϕ
        (
        x
        )
          |
        ≤
        a
        }
        .
    {\displaystyle K=\{x\in X:|\phi (x)|\leq a\}.}
Again we define
        p
        (
        x
        )
        =
        inf
          {
          r
          >
          0
          :
          x
          ∈
          r
          K
          }
        .
    {\displaystyle p(x)=\inf \left\{r>0:x\in rK\right\}.}
Then
        p
        (
        x
        )
        =
            1
            a
          |
        ϕ
        (
        x
        )
          |
        .
    {\displaystyle p(x)={\frac {1}{a}}|\phi (x)|.}
The function p(x) is another instance of a Minkowski functional. It has the following properties:
It is subadditive: p(x + y) ≤ p(x) + p(y),
It is homogeneous: for all α ∈ K, p(α x) = |α| p(x),
It is nonnegative.
Therefore p is a seminorm on X, with an induced topology. This is characteristic of Minkowski functionals defined via "nice" sets. There is a one-to-one correspondence between seminorms and the Minkowski functional given by such sets. What is meant precisely by "nice" is discussed in the section below.
Notice that, in contrast to a stronger requirement for a norm, p(x) = 0 need not imply x = 0. In the above example, one can take a nonzero x from the kernel of φ. Consequently, the resulting topology need not be Hausdorff.
The above examples suggest that, given a (complex or real) vector space X and a subset K, one can define a corresponding Minkowski functional
          p
            K
        :
        X
        →
        [
        0
        ,
        ∞
        )
    {\displaystyle p_{K}:X\rightarrow [0,\infty )}
by
          p
            K
        (
        x
        )
        =
        inf
          {
          r
          >
          0
          :
          x
          ∈
          r
          K
          }
        ,
    {\displaystyle p_{K}(x)=\inf \left\{r>0:x\in rK\right\},}
which is often called the gauge of 
        K
    {\displaystyle K}
  .
It is implicitly assumed in this definition that 0 ∈ K and the set {r > 0: x ∈ r K} is nonempty for every x. In order for pK to have the properties of a seminorm, additional restrictions must be imposed on K. These conditions are listed below.
The set K being convex implies the subadditivity of pK.
Homogeneity, i.e. pK(α x) = |α| pK(x) for all α, is ensured if K is balanced, meaning α K ⊂ K for all |α| ≤ 1.
A set K with these properties is said to be absolutely convex.
A simple geometric argument that shows convexity of K implies subadditivity is as follows. Suppose for the moment that pK(x) = pK(y) = r. Then for all ε > 0, we have x, y ∈ (r + ε) K = K' . The assumption that K is convex means K' is also. Therefore ½ x + ½ y is in K' . By definition of the Minkowski functional pK, one has
          p
            K
          (
              1
              2
          x
          +
              1
              2
          y
          )
        ≤
        r
        +
        ϵ
        =
            1
            2
          p
            K
        (
        x
        )
        +
            1
            2
          p
            K
        (
        y
        )
        +
        ϵ
        .
    {\displaystyle p_{K}\left({\frac {1}{2}}x+{\frac {1}{2}}y\right)\leq r+\epsilon ={\frac {1}{2}}p_{K}(x)+{\frac {1}{2}}p_{K}(y)+\epsilon .}
But the left hand side is ½ pK(x + y), i.e. the above becomes
          p
            K
        (
        x
        +
        y
        )
        ≤
          p
            K
        (
        x
        )
        +
          p
            K
        (
        y
        )
        +
        ϵ
        ,
          for all
        ϵ
        >
        0.
    {\displaystyle p_{K}(x+y)\leq p_{K}(x)+p_{K}(y)+\epsilon ,\quad {\mbox{for all}}\quad \epsilon >0.}
This is the desired inequality. The general case pK(x) > pK(y) is obtained after the obvious modification.
Note Convexity of K, together with the initial assumption that the set {r > 0: x ∈ r K} is nonempty, implies that K is absorbent.
Notice that K being balanced implies that
        λ
        x
        ∈
        r
        K
          if and only if
        x
        ∈
            r
                |
              λ
                |
        K
        .
    {\displaystyle \lambda x\in rK\quad {\mbox{if and only if}}\quad x\in {\frac {r}{|\lambda |}}K.}
Therefore
          p
            K
        (
        λ
        x
        )
        =
        inf
          {
          r
          >
          0

          λ
          x
          ∈
          r
          K
          }
        =
        inf
          {
          r
          >
          0
          :
          x
          ∈
              r
                  |
                λ
