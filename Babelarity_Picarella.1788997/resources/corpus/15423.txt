Ernesto Antonio Farías (born 29 May 1980) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays for Colombian club América de Cali as a striker.
Born in Trenque Lauquen, Buenos Aires, Farías started playing professionally in 1997 for Estudiantes de La Plata, making his Primera División debut in a 2–2 draw against Club Atlético Lanús, 19 days shy of his 18th birthday. From his third season onwards he never scored less than 14 league goals, including 12 in the 2003 Apertura alone, a competition-best, as his team ranked in midtable.
Farías left Estudiantes as the club's fifth-ever goal scorer, netting nearly one goal every two games. He signed with Italian club U.S. Città di Palermo for the 2004–05 campaign, teaming up with compatriot Mariano González and appearing in only 13 Serie A matches, going scoreless in the process.
Subsequently, Farías returned to his country and joined Club Atlético River Plate, being crowned top scorer in the 2006 edition of the Copa Libertadores at five (tied with 13 other players) as the Buenos Aires side reached the quarterfinals. In late July 2007, after a failed transfer to Deportivo Toluca F.C. for personal reasons, he signed a four-year contract for FC Porto, in a €4 million deal.
During his three-year spell in Portugal, Farías was mostly used as a substitute, consecutively barred by Lisandro López, Hulk and Radamel Falcao. He still managed to contribute solidly to the conquest of five major titles by scoring 34 official goals, 23 of those coming in the Primeira Liga.
In January 2010, Farías had everything arranged with Cruzeiro Esporte Clube as part of the deal involving Kléber, but the move eventually collapsed. In late July he finally joined the Brazilians, agreeing on a three-year contract; he scored his first goal for the club on 9 June, in a 3–2 win over Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras.
In late January 2012, Farías returned to his country and signed with Club Atlético Independiente, on loan.
On 3 September 2005, Farías gained his first – and only – cap for the Argentine national team, in a 0–1 away loss against Paraguay for the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. Previously, in 1999, he appeared for the under-20s in the World Cup held in Nigeria, playing in three games in an eventual round-of-16 exit.
Farías is nicknamed El Tecla ("The key"), because in his early adolescence years his uneven teeth were likened to a piano.
