The slender-billed parakeet also called the long-billed parakeet (Enicognathus leptorhynchus), is a medium size South American parrot. It belongs to the smaller long-tailed Arinae (macaws and parakeets). It is known by the local common name choroy.
It is endemic to southern Chile; its natural habitat is temperate forests, and its range stretches from central Chile at the level of Mt Aconcagua down to the island of Chiloe and the continental section of the country. The birds are social and flock together in large numbers; they are not especially afraid of humans and the sighting of flocks in urban areas is not uncommon.
The species is reported to be locally common and is in the IUCN Red list category Least Concern.
