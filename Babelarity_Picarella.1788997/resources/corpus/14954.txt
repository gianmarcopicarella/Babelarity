The 5000 metres or 5000-meter run (approximately 3.1 mi or 16,404 ft) is a common long-distance running event in track and field. It is one of the track events in the Olympic Games and the World Championships in Athletics, run over 12.5 laps of a standard track. The same distance in road running is called a 5K run. The 5000 m has been present on the Olympic programme since 1912 for men and since 1996 for women. Prior to 1996, women had competed in an Olympic 3000 metres race since 1984. The 5000 m has been held at each of the World Championships in Athletics in men's competition and since 1995 in women's.
The event is almost the same length as the dolichos race held at the Ancient Olympic Games, introduced in 720 BCE. While mainly run as an outdoor event, the 5000 m is sometimes run on an indoor track. The IAAF keeps official records for both outdoor and indoor 5000 m track events.
"i" indicates indoor performance.
