1965 van de Kamp (2521 P–L) is an asteroid from the asteroid belt, discovered on September 24, 1960 by Cornelis van Houten and Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld at Leiden, on photographic plates taken by Tom Gehrels at Palomar, California. The asteroid measures about 12 kilometer in diameter and has a geometric albedo of 0.20. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.3–2.8 AU once every 4.12 years (1,504 days) and takes 36 hours to rotate around its axis.
The designation P–L stands for Palomar–Leiden, named after Palomar Observatory and Leiden Observatory, which collaborated on the fruitful Palomar–Leiden survey in the 1960s. Gehrels used Palomar's Samuel Oschin telescope (also known as the 48-inch Schmidt Telescope), and shipped the photographic plates to Cornelis Johannes van Houten and Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld at Leiden Observatory. The trio are credited with several thousand asteroid discoveries.
The asteroid was named after Dutch astronomer Peter van de Kamp (1901–1995), director of Sproul Observatory and known for his research on astrometric binaries.
