The Morocco national football team (Arabic: منتخب المغرب لكرة القدم‎‎ ; Tamaziǧt : Tarabbut anamur n Maghrib), nicknamed أسود الأطلس / Irzem n Atlasi (Lions of the Atlas), is the national team of Morocco. It is currently managed by Hervé Renard.
Winners of the African Nations Cup in 1976, they were the first African and Amazigh team to win a group at the World Cup, which they did in 1986, finishing ahead of Portugal, Poland, and England. They were also the first African and Amazigh team to make it to second round barely losing to eventual runners-up West Germany 1–0 in 1986. They also came within two minutes of moving out of the group stage of the 1998 World Cup, Kjetil Rekdal's late winning goal for Norway against Brazil eliminating them.
After a decade-long drought, glory came back in 2012 for the Moroccan national team in when they were victorious in the 2012 Arab Nations Cup defeating Libya in the final. On 5 February 2015, The CAF Executive Committee decided to suspend the Morocco national football team from the next two editions of the Africa Cup of Nations, 2017 and 2019, and to impose on the Royal Moroccan Football Federation the regulatory fine of US$1 million, along with the sum of 8.05 million Euros in compensation for all material damage sustained by CAF, stakeholders and partners as a result of the decision not to host 2015 edition. However, the ban was overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, meaning Morocco may enter the tournaments.
The Moroccan National team traditionally used the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in (Rabat) and the Stade Mohamed V in (Casablanca) as their main stadiums, but they've recently started using the new Stade de Marrakech in (Marrakech) and Stade Adrar in (Agadir).
Morocco's national football team participated four times in the FIFA World Cup. Their best performance was the 1986 edition when they advanced to the second round, being the first African nation to do so. In 1998, the team narrowly missed repeating the same achievement.
Since 1992, the Olympic team has been drawn from a squad with a maximum of three players over 23 years age, and the achievements of this team are not generally regarded as part of the national team's records, nor are the statistics credited to the players' international records.
