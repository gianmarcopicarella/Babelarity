Kugyō (公卿) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court's actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.
In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career. During Reigen's reign, this apex of the Daijō-kan included:
Sesshō, Nijō Mitsuhira, 1663–1664
Sessho, Takatsukasa Fusasuke, 1664–1668
Kampaku, Takatsukasa Fusasuke, 1668–1682
Kampaku, Ichijō Kaneteru, 1682–1687
Sadaijin
Udaijin
Naidaijin
Dainagon
