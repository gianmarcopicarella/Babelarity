José Luis López Vázquez de la Torre (11 March 1922, in Madrid – 2 November 2009, in Madrid) was a Spanish actor.
José Luis López Vázquez was born in Madrid, Spain. He originally worked in theater as a costume designer, a scenic designer, and as an assistant director to Pío Ballesteros and Enrique Herreros. In 1946, he switched over to film, with a small role in the movie María Fernanda la Jerezana. Originally starring in comic roles, he made the move to drama films in the 1960s, demonstrating his profund aptitude for acting.
During his life, he starred in more than 200 movies, filming several full-length films in a year. In 1971, he acted in 11 films. Although he usually appeared in Spanish films, he occasionally worked on international projects: in the UK film Travels With My Aunt from 1972, starring opposite Dame Maggie Smith. His best-known role may be in the Emmy-winning film, La Cabina, which was filmed the same year with director Antonio Mercero. López Vázquez worked with Mercero on numerous other occasions, the last being their collaboration on a movie called ¿Y tú quién eres? (2006).
