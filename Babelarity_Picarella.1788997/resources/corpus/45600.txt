Jörg Michael (born March 27, 1963) is a German drummer. He is well known for his time in the Finnish power metal band Stratovarius, the German thrash metal band Headhunter, and several other bands.
Most of the bands Michael has played with are in the power metal genre. The first album he recorded was Prayers of Steel with Avenger (the band would later change their name to Rage). By the mid-1980s he was no longer attached to a single band but concentrated on working as a studio session drummer; hence the long list of bands and albums he has been involved with.
