Suffolk University is a private, non-sectarian research university located in downtown Boston, Massachusetts, United States. With 10,192 students (includes all campuses, 8,891 at the Boston location alone), it is the eighth largest university in the City of Boston. It is categorized as a Doctoral Research University by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. It was founded as a law school in 1906 and named after its location in Suffolk County, Massachusetts. The university's notable alumni include mayors, dozens of U.S. federal and state judges and United States members of Congress.
The university, located at the downtown edge of the historic Beacon Hill neighborhood, is coeducational and comprises the Suffolk University Law School, the College of Arts & Sciences, and the Sawyer Business School.
The Princeton Review recently ranked the Sawyer Business School as "One of Top 15 in Global Management" and its entrepreneurship program is ranked among the top 25 in the U.S. The Princeton Review, also currently ranks some of its MBA programs among the top 50 business programs in the nation. The 2015 edition of U.S. News publication ranked Suffolk Law School 9th in the United States for its Legal Writing, 13th for its Alternative Dispute Resolution program, and 20th for legal clinics. It has an international campus in Madrid in addition to the main campus in downtown Boston. Due to its strategic location and well-known law school, many notable scholars, prominent speakers and politicians have visited the university such as John F. Kennedy, Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist, and former U.S. President George H.W. Bush, all have given speeches at Suffolk.
The university's sports teams, the Suffolk Rams, compete in NCAA Division III as members of the GNAC and the ECAC in 13 varsity sports.
Suffolk University was initially founded as a law school in 1906 by Boston lawyer Gleason Archer, Sr., who named it "Archer's Evening Law School," intending it for law students who worked during the day. The school was renamed Suffolk School of Law in 1907, after Archer moved it from his Roxbury, Massachusetts home into his law offices in downtown Boston.
A year later the first of Archer's students had passed the bar, leading to a boost in registration. The school's original goal was to "serve ambitious young men who are obliged to work for a living while studying law."
By 1930, Archer developed Suffolk into one of the largest law schools in the country, and decided to create "a great evening university" that working people could afford.
The school became a university in the 1930s when the Suffolk College of Arts and Sciences was founded in 1934 and the Sawyer Business School—then known as the College of Business Administration—in 1937. That same year, the three academic units were incorporated as Suffolk University.
During the 1990s Suffolk constructed its first residence halls, began satellite programs with other colleges in Massachusetts, and opened its international campuses. From 1990 to 2005, its endowment increased over 400%, to approximately $72 million, and enrollment climbed.
On February 5, 2016, Suffolk University President Margaret McKenna and Board of Trustees Chairman Andrew Meyer, Jr., announced an agreement, formulated in the best interest of the University following a trustees quest to remove the president from her position after seven months in office. Meyer said he would not seek re-election after his term expires in May 2016. Following the election of a new board chair and the adoption of new bylaws, a search committee would be formed to initiate a search process for a new, permanent president, and McKenna would step down when a new president takes office in the beginning of the 2017-18 academic year. 
The main campus in downtown Boston is situated on well-known Beacon Hill, adjacent to the Massachusetts State House and the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. Up until 1995, Suffolk was a commuter-only school. Today, there are four coed residence halls, housing about 70% of freshman, and a total of 22% of the entire undergraduate population. The Residence Halls are:
150 Tremont
Miller Hall
10 West
Modern Theatre
The residence hall at 150 Tremont Street was the first built by the university and currently houses students in singles, doubles, quads, and suites, with communal bathrooms. Nathan R. Miller Residence Hall (located at 10 Somerset St.) was opened in 2005 and houses 15 floors of freshman, and 2 floors of sophomores in singles, doubles and quads, with bathrooms shared between every two rooms or one bathroom per quad.
The 10 West Residence Hall, opened in 2008, has housing for freshman and sophomores in singles and doubles. Suites accommodate 3-5 students and a variety of apartment-style suites (that include full kitchens) house 2 to 8 students.
Both Miller Hall and 150 Tremont have cafeterias. Students living at 10 West/Modern Theater can eat at 150 Tremont. Suffolk University occasionally leases additional properties (such as the Hyatt & Holiday Inn Beacon Hill). If leased, those locations house freshman students. In 2015, due to a long housing waitlist, Suffolk housed additional freshman at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design and MCPHS University.
The Modern Theatre Residence Hall opened in the fall of 2010 and is considered an extension to the 10 West Resident Hall. The two residence halls share one entrance at 10 West Street. The Modern Theater Residence Hall is built over the restored Modern Theatre (Boston).
In addition to its main campus in Boston, there are satellite campuses in Madrid, Spain, and Cape Cod, Massachusetts.
Suffolk employs over 900 full-time and adjunct faculty members, who instruct approximately 10,000 undergraduate and graduate students on its Boston Campus.
The Sawyer Business School (previously the Sawyer School of Management) focuses on global business education. It offers undergraduate and graduate degrees. Joint degrees are also offered. About 3,000 students are currently enrolled in all programs. The Saturday-only Executive MBA Program incorporates four off-site one-week seminars and week-long global trips to London and China. The Global MBA is a specialized MBA in international business with an intensive concentration in either finance or marketing. The full-time program includes a 3-month internship outside the student's home country. Summer 2010 Global MBA internships are in 10 countries. Part-time Global MBAs complete either a global experiential research project at their place of business or a 3-month consulting project that includes an intensive 2 week residency outside the US.
The Suffolk College of Arts and Sciences has seventeen academic departments which offer more than seventy undergraduate and graduate programs. Among the departments is the New England School of Art and Design (NESAD)
Suffolk University Law School, founded in 1906, offers a standard Juris Doctor program and advanced L.L.M. program. 43% of applicants were admitted to the J.D. program in 2005.
The university is also home to various research centers and institutes, including the Beacon Hill Institute, a "free-market think-tank," the Centers for Crime & Justice Policy Research, Restorative Justice, and Women's Health and Human Right, the Poetry Center, Political Research Centers, the R.S. Friedman Field Station, and the Sagan Energy Research Laboratory. The Suffolk University Political Research Center (SUPRC) conducts various scientific polls of national and regional political issues.
