Mitsuoka Motors (光岡自動車) is a small Japanese automobile company. It is noted for building unique cars with unconventional styling, some of which imitate British vehicles of the 1950s and 1960s. It is primarily a coachbuilder, taking production cars, like the Nissan March, and replacing various aspects of the bodywork with its own custom designs. It has also produced a sports car, the Orochi. Mitsuoka Motors is also the principal distributor of retro-classic TD2000 roadster in Japan. Mitsuoka was recognised in 1996 as the 10th Japanese auto manufacturer to be registered in Japan since Honda in 1963. It bases its current cars on Nissans and Other Japanese car manufacturers. Mitsuoka Motor Has a sales outlet in England and is soon to launch the Mitsuoka Roadster (Himiko) in the UK which is based on the Mazda Roadster.
