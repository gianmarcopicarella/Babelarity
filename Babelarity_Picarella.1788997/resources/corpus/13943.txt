The contract also mentioned that a friendly match will be played between Groningen and Hamburg in the summer of 2010 or 2011 in the Euroborg, the main stadium of Groningen.

Swedish press criticised this decision and Berg demanded first team football in the National Team after the final whistle.“Ola Toivonen is a kind of a different player than me and this decision has been taken. But it's pretty clear that I want to play as I'm in a decent form,” the Panathinaikos striker underlined straight after the game.
