Bicas is a Brazilian municipality in the state of Minas Gerais. As of 2004 its population is estimated to be 13.590 inhabitants.
Initially a breakpoint for salesmen in the 18th century, Bicas obtained its independence from the city of Guarar√° in 1923. It was an attraction point for Italian immigrants and also other nationalities.
Until the 1970s, Bicas had a full-working train station and an active RFFSA (the extinct state railroad company) branch for repairing wagons. Unfortunately, all this structure was dismantled and today the train station exists only as a historic site. Currently, Bicas has an economy based on commerce, agriculture and farming.
Annual Farming Expositions, with bull-riding and rodeos, cattle commerce and local products - typically in the last week of July of every year - are a tradition of several cities in Zona da Mata, and the Farming Exposition of Bicas is one of the most famous, attracting thousands of tourists from several parts of the country.
