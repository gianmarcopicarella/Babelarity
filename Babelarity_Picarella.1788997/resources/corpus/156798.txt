Tazewell County was formed out of Peoria County in 1827. The consensus appears to be that it was named in honor of Littleton Tazewell, who served in the U.S. Senate, and who became Governor of Virginia in 1834. It is, however, possible that it was named for Littleton's father, prominent Virginia politician Henry Tazewell, for whom Tazewell County, Virginia, was named.
