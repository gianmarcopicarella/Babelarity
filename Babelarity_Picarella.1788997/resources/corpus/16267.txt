The Faroe Islands Cup (Faroese: Løgmanssteypið) is the main football cup competition in Faroe Islands. The first edition was played in 1955.
The first decade of the competition was marked by the alternance of titles between HB and TB. In subsequent editions, teams like B36, KÍ and currently inactive GÍ were also champions, but not enough to approach the number of titles of HB. However, in recent years, the cup has been dominated by EB/Streymur and Víkingur, which are in alternance of titles in the past nine editions and have already made 3 finals (all won by Víkingur).
Note
The clubs in Italics no longer exist.
