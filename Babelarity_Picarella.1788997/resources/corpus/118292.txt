1958 Chandra, provisionally designated 1970 SB, is a carbonaceous asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt, about 34 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Argentinian astronomer Carlos Cesco at the Yale–Columbia Southern Station of the Leoncito Astronomical Complex, San Juan, Argentina (also see Félix Aguilar Observatory).
The dark C-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.6–3.6 AU once every 5 years and 6 months (1,996 days). Its orbit is tilted by 11 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic and shows an eccentricity of 0.17. Two concurring light-curve analysis rendered a rotation period of 7.1 hours in 2010 and 2014, respectively. According to the survey carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, IRAS, the body's surface has an albedo of 0.080, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an lower albedo of 0.05, which is typical value for carbonaceous asteroids.
The asteroid was named in honor of Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar (1910–1995), the Nobel Prize winning Indian–American theoretical astrophysicist (also see Chandrasekhar limit).
