The men's Keirin at the 2012 Olympic Games in London took place at the London Velopark on 7 August.
Chris Hoy from Great Britain won the gold medal.
The Keirin races involve 6.5 laps of the track behind a pace-setter, followed by a 2.5 lap sprint to the finish. The tournament consisted of preliminary heats and repechages, a semi-finals round, and the finals. The heats and repechages narrowed the field to 12. The semi-finals divided the remaining 12 into six finalists. The final round also included a ranking race for 7th to 12th place.
