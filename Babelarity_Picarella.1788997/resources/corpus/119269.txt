1259 Ogyalla, provisional designation 1933 BT, is a stony asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt, about 33 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at Heidelberg Observatory in southern Germany on 29 January 1933.
The S-type asteroid is a member of the Themis family, a dynamical family of outer-belt asteroids with nearly coplanar ecliptical orbits. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.7–3.5 AU once every 5 years and 6 months (1,999 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.13 and is tilted by 2 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. It has a rotation period of 17.3 hours and an albedo of 0.06–0.07, according to the surveys carried out by IRAS, Akari, and WISE/NEOWISE.
The minor planet was named after the seismological, meteorological and astronomical observatory in the former Hungarian city of Ógyalla, since 1948 known as Hurbanovo, in south-west Slovakia.
