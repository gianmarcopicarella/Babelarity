Rafael Nadal, the defending champion and, after this tournament, six-time winner of this event defended his title by beating long-time rival Roger Federer 7–5, 7–6(7–3), 5–7, 6–1 for his sixth French Open title, tying him with Björn Borg for most in the open era. In the first round, the Spaniard played his first five-set match at Roland Garros since his debut in 2005, beating John Isner. This edition of the tournament witnessed the top four seeds advancing to the semifinals. The tournament saw the end of the streak of Novak Djokovic, who was one away from tying John McEnroe for best start to a season with 42 wins, before he was defeated by Federer in the semifinals.
Although this was the sixth time that Nadal won the French Open, this was the first time since 2001 in which the men's top seed won the French Open.
