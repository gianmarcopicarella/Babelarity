Hilfikon was a municipality in the district of Bremgarten in the canton of Aargau in Switzerland. In January 2010 Hilfikon merged into Villmergen.
Hilfikon is first mentioned in 924 as Hilfiniswilare. In 1250 it was mentioned as Hilfinchon. In 1290 Markwart and Arnold von Hilfikon built a tower house in Hilfikon. The area ruled by the Hilfikon family is first documented in 1415. Though, by 1472 it was owned by the Meiss family of Zurich, then in 1498 it became a fief of Hans von Seengen, and in 1506–10 it was owned by Melchior von Gilgen of Lucerne. He also purchased the Bailiwick of Sarmenstorf in 1514, and in 1510 donated a chapel. In 1628 the property was purchased by John Lussi Landamman for Unterwalden, then in 1644 it went to the Zwyer family of Evibach in Silenen. In 1743 the village transferred by marriage to the Tschudi family of Glarus, which were deposed in 1749 by Augustin Victor Franz Roll from Solothurn. He had the late gothic chapel demolished and a new chapel built. The new chapel's choir is a replica of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Religiously, Hilfikon has always belonged to the Villmergen parish. So, in 1743 a part of the village came under the power of Villmergen's courts, while the other part remained under the nobles' courts. In 1798 Augustine von Roll eliminated this division of judicial authority.
During the second Toggenburg War, in 1712, the castle was the seat of the Catholic General Staff. In 1832 the castle was sold along with other properties and has since had several owners.
Into the 20th century the small town was dominated by agriculture and a few small businesses. In 1916, the Wohlen-Meisterschwanden Railway was built, to which Hilfikon was a station. The village has a comprehensive school for primary education.
In 2010 Hilfikon merged into Villmergen.
