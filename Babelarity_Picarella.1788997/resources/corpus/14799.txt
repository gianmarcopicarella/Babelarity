The Rally of Poland (in Polish, Rajd Polski) is a motorsport event for rally cars that was first established in 1921. It is second-oldest rally in the world, preceded only by Monte Carlo Rally. In 1973, the Rally of Poland was the one of the thirtern rounds of newly established FIA World Rally Championship, but was removed from the 1974 calendar. It later found a place as a round of the European Rally Championship, and after a move to Miko≈Çajki in the Masurian Lake District in 2005, event organisers started lobbying for the event's inclusion as a round of the World Rally Championship. After being run as a candidate event in 2007 and 2008, Poland returned to the World Rally Chamiopnship in 2009, which was won by Mikko Hirvonen. However, the event was once again removed after a single season, and was replaced by Rally Bulgaria.
During the 2012 season, the FIA put forward a tender for new events, and after a delay of one year, considered events in Brazil, China, India, Russia, South Africa and Poland for inclusion on the 2014 season calendar. The Rally of Poland was the successful candidate, and will return to the championship in 2014. The proposed route will feature stages in nearby Lithuania, in a format similar to the Rally of Sweden, which crosses over the border into Norway.
