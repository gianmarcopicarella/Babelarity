Bugojno is a town and municipality in central Bosnia and Herzegovina, situated by the river Vrbas. It is located in the Central Bosnia Canton of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina entity. The town is 130 km (81 mi) to the northwest from Sarajevo. Before the war, it was a multi-ethnic town, now predominantly Bosniak.
To the west towards Kupres is a region called Koprivica. This enormous forest was once one of President Tito's favorite hunting spots. The uninhabited dense forest has created a sanctuary for wild animals. Hunting associations are very active in this region and there are many mountain and hunting lodges dotting the forest. Duboka Valley (deep valley) is a designated hunting area covered by thick spruce. Kalin Mountain is a popular weekend area for hikers and nature lovers.
The municipality of Bugojno has an average elevation of 570 meters above sea level. Much of its 366 km2 is forested. The terrain is mountainous with several prominent features. Stozer (1662m), Kalin (1,530m) and Rudina (1,385m) are the tallest mountains in Bugojno.

Bugojno was once a major industrial center in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1981, Bugujno's GDP per capita was 98% of the Yugoslav average. However, hardships caused by the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina took a toll on the industry and overall economy of Bugojno. Apart from industry, forestry has been an important contributor to the local economy and continues to be. In recent years, agriculture has grown in sustaining the Bugojno's economy as many people are investing in land and agronomy.
