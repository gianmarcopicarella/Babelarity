Club Atlético Unión (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈkluβ aˈtletiko uˈnjon]; mostly known as Unión de Santa Fe [uˈnjon de santa ˈfe], CA Unión de Santa Fe or simply Unión) is a sports club from Santa Fe, the capital city of the Santa Fe Province, in Argentina. The club was founded in April 15, 1907 and plays in the Argentine Primera División.
Although Unión is mostly known for its football team, that currently plays in Primera División, the club hosts other sports such as archery, basketball, field hockey, gymnastics, martial arts, roller skating, swimming and volleyball.
In 1965, the football team was promoted to the Segunda División Argentina for the first time. The team has played there for many years, alternating with periods in the second division. Unión's supporters are called "unionistas", "tatengues", while the squad is usually nicknamed "El Tate". The colours of the club consist of red and white vertical stripes.
In 1979 Unión played the final matches of the Nacional championship, but lost at the hands of River Plate, because the goal scored by River in the first match (with a final score of 1–1) ended up in an average over Union according to the away goals rule applied to that tournament.
The most famous footballers who played for Unión are Leopoldo Luque, World Cup winner with Argentina in 1978, and Nery Pumpido, the goalkeeper of the national team that won the World Cup in Mexico 1986.
Apart from football, basketball is the foremost sport practised at the institution, with Union's team currently in the third division. Carlos Delfino is its most famous basketball player.
Unión and Colón are the two largest football clubs in Santa Fe. The Clásico Santafesino is known as one of football's fiercest and most important rivalries in Argentina. Unión and Colón have played 105 games all time against each other in the Professional Era, with Unión winning 37, Colón winning 31 and 37 draws.
