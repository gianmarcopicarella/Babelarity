Paris Métro Line 7bis is the second shortest line of the metro operating in Paris, France. It serves the 19th and 20th arrondissements in the North East of the city.
18 January 1911: The section between Louis Blanc and Pré-Saint-Gervais was opened as a branch of Line 7.
1967 : Because of a lack of traffic, the branch became a separate line known as line 7bis.
Métro Line 7bis serves the Parc des Buttes Chaumont.
The merger of line 3bis and line 7bis, connected through an existing rail tunnel and allowing the opening of a closed station (Haxo), is being studied. The line 7 bis would be extended one station west to have its terminus at Château-Landon. The resulting line from Château-Landon to Gambetta would become a new line and be put in operation between 2013 and 2020.
