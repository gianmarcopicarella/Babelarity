Pecos County is a county located in the U.S. state of Texas. As of the 2010 census, its population was 15,507. The county seat is Fort Stockton. The county was created in 1871 and organized in 1875. It is named for the Pecos River. It is one of the nine counties that comprise the Trans-Pecos region of West Texas.
Archeological digs at Squawteat Peak uncovered prehistoric hunter-gatherer artifacts. 14 clusters of stones interpreted as wickiup and tipi rings indicate human habitation. A ring midden in the camp provided a radiocarbon date of 1300 A.D. Archeological finds along Tunas Creek include a burial site, pictographs, and artifacts; a possible modified Langtry projectile point (2,000 B.C. to A.D. 700–800).
The Comanche Trail crossed Pecos County near Horsehead Crossing and through Comanche Springs. The Chihuahua Trail connecting Mexico’s state of Chihuahua with Santa Fe, New Mexico brought travelers through the area by Comanche Springs about 1840.
United States Army outpost, Fort Stockton, was established in 1858 at Comanche Springs to guard the San Antonio-El Paso Mail. That same year the Butterfield Overland Mail began service to the army post.
The town of Fort Stockton began near the Fort Stockton army post at Comanche Springs as St. Gall, Texas but was renamed Fort Stockton, Texas in 1880. Pecos County was established by the Texas legislature in 1871 originally out of Presidio County. In 1971, Pecos County was organized and St. Gall (which would be renamed Fort Stockton) was named the county seat. There were 1,100 people living in the county that year. By 1890 the county had 227 cattle and 150 sheep that year, and 1,300 acres (5.3 km2) were planted in corn. By 1900 the area's economy had become almost completely dominated by cattle and sheep ranching, though plots of wheat, rye, corn, and oats were grown. Around 1900, a small settlement known as Sheffield sprang up in eastern Pecos County on land owned by Will Sheffield and served as a supply point for the surrounding ranches. In 1913, construction of the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway across Pecos County caused a boom in land speculation and community growth, as did irrigation projects along the Pecos River. The town of Girvin, named for rancher John H. Girvin, grew around a train stop on the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway that served as a cattle shipping point. Construction of Texas State Highway 290 linking Fort Stockton to Big Bend National Park gave a boost to the tourism dollar. In the 1980s the economy of Pecos County continued to be based on farming, ranching, oil and gas production, and tourism. The Yates Oil Field in Crockett County, Texas and Pecos County in 1927 resulted in a financial boom period for the county. Towns such as Red Barn, Iraan (combination of the names Ira and Ann Yates) and Bakersfield rose up in response to oil-related employment opportunities. The population of the county more than doubled during the 1920s. Oil production helped to stabilize the local economy.
The town of Iraan, Texas prides itself on being the birthplace of cartoon caveman Alley Oop', when creator V.T. Hamlin worked in the oilfields. Although first published in the Des Moines Register in 1932, Hamilin claimed to have originated the idea while he watched dinosaur bones being dug up by oil equipment. Visitors to Iraan, Texas can visit the Alley Oop Museum found on Alley Oop Lane. Fort Stockton pays tribute to the agile roadrunner with their Paisano Pete the Roadrunner statue.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 4,765 square miles (12,340 km2), of which 4,764 square miles (12,340 km2) is land and 1.0 square mile (2.6 km2) (0.02%) is water. It is the second-largest county by area in Texas by area.
Pecos County is home to one of the largest oil fields in the United States, the Yates Oil Field, which is in the extreme eastern part of the county, along the Pecos River. The field covers approximately 41 square miles (110 km2) near the town of Iraan, Texas. Discovered in 1926, it has produced over a billion barrels of oil, and most industry estimates give it more than another billion in recoverable reserves. The Yates Oil Field was one of the first giant fields to be found in the Permian Basin.

The center was built in 1996 - through a joint effort by Midland College, and by leaders of Fort Stockton education, business and government - as a means to enhance higher education and workforce development in this part of West Texas. Fort Stockton and Pecos County are part of the Midland College service area. After just four years, the facility - named in honor of Fort Stockton native and WRTTC donor Clayton Williams - was doubled in size through fundraising and program development.
