Miami County is a county located in the U.S. state of Indiana. As of 2010, the population was 36,903. The county seat is Peru.
Indiana became a state on December 11, 1816, after being Indiana territory for sixteen years. Originally, Indiana was part of the Northwest Territory, which was made up of land gained by the British after the French and Indian War and organized into a territory after the American Revolution. It was after the revolution that settlement in the area by Europeans really began. Knox territory was created in 1790 and included all of present-day Indiana and areas of Illinois. Ancestry’s Red Book notes that jurisdiction in Knox territory changed due to Indian uprisings in the area from 1790-1810. In 1800, Indiana became the name of a territory. Parts Michigan and Illinois both broke away from the territory before it became a state in 1816.
Miami County was formed in 1832 from Cass County and unorganized land. It was named for the Miami, a Native American people, many of whom still live in this area. In 1834, Miami County widened its western border taking some area from Cass County. In 1838 a small portion of unorganized territory was added to the northeastern border, but in 1844 that area was lost to Fulton County. Miami County has been its present shape since 1844.
According to the 2010 census, the county has a total area of 377.39 square miles (977.4 km2), of which 373.84 square miles (968.2 km2) (or 99.06%) is land and 3.55 square miles (9.2 km2) (or 0.94%) is water.
