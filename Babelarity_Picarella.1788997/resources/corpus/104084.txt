Glenrock is a town in Converse County, Wyoming, United States. The population was 2,576 at the 2010 census.
Glenrock, known as Deer Creek Station, had its beginning as a mail and stage station along the Oregon Trail. The station served as a relay and eating place and was a vital supply point for thousands of emigrants as they traveled westward. The discovery of oil in 1889 greatly contributed to the economy of central Wyoming and especially Glenrock.
Rock in the Glen
This landmark has been viewed by an estimated 350,000 immigrants that have migrated westward since the mid-1800s. In 1812, it was first discovered by American fur trappers during a creation of a fur trapping route. This trappers trail has known many names depending upon the group traveling upon it. These names include the Oregon, California, and Mormon trails.
Mormon Mines
On June 10, 1847, the first group of Mormons reached Deer Creek in the Glenrock region. A mere ten days later, a coal mine produced the first recorded coal mined in the Wyoming territory.
Deer Creek Station
Originally, Deer Creek Station stood as a pioneer and Indian trading post in the 1850s and as a relay terminal for the overland stage system. Ten years later in 1860, it would become a “home station for the pony express.” In 1861, the station became incorporated into the telegraph system. On October 18, 1861, the telegrapher at Deer Creek Station helped to send along the first relayed message to Cleveland, Ohio from the West. As the telegraphy began to replace the pony express, the relationship between Indians and the U.S. Government worsened in the Glenrock region. Over the course of three years, from 1862-1866, Deer Creek Station stood as a military outpost. With few troops stationed in the fort, in 1866, Indians burned it down, this includes the telegraph station located in Deer Creek Station. It was never rebuilt as traffic on the old trails dwindled and it became part of the past.
