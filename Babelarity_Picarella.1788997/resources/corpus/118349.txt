1996 Adams, provisional designation 1961 UA, is a stony asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, about 13 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 16 October 1961, at the U.S. Goethe Link Observatory near Brooklyn, Indiana, by the Indiana Asteroid Program.
The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL) classifies the asteroid as a member of the Eunomia family, a large group of S-type asteroids and the most prominent family in the intermediate main-belt. However, based on its concurring orbital elements, Alvarez-Candal from the Universidad Nacional de Córdoba, groups the asteroid into the Maria family, which is named after 170 Maria (also see 9175 Graun).
The S-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.2–2.9 AU once every 4 years and 1 month (1,494 days). Its orbit is tilted by 15 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic and shows an eccentricity of 0.14. It has an albedo in the range of 0.14–0.40, according to observations made by the space-based satellites Akari and WISE/NEOWISE, while CALL assumed an intermediate albedo of 0.21, which is typical value for stony asteroids. Based upon a large number of measurements of its light-curve, the body has a concurring synodic rotation period of 7000330000000000000♠3.3 hours.
The minor planet is named after John Couch Adams (1819–1892), British mathematician and astronomer, who predicted the existence and position of Neptune, simultaneously with French mathematician Urbain Le Verrier, (also see 1997 Leverrier). The lunar crater Adams is also named in his honour.
