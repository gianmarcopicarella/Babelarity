Luigi Marchisio (26 April 1909 â€“ 3 July 1992) was an Italian professional road racing cyclist.
Marchisio was born at Castelnuovo, Piedmont. The highlight of his career was his overall win in the 1930 Giro d'Italia, the youngest victor ever at the time (he was beat only by Fausto Coppi's victory in 1940). Marchisio was also 3rd in the 1931 Giro d'Italia, but subsequently he failed to achieve any result of note. He retired in 1936.
Marchisio died in 1992.
