From 1852 until 1892 the area was known as "Blue Pond". When a railroad came through Interlachen in the 1870s, the area opened up to settlers. The town developed economically as a winter vacation spot and citrus growing area. The town of Interlachen was incorporated in 1888. The Hastings Seed House was organized in 1889, moving to Atlanta, Ga. ten years later. In 1891, the Interlachen Town Hall burned down. Another was built to replace it the following year and it still stands - now housing a museum. When the Great Freeze hit in 1895, the town's tourism and citrus sharply declined. In 1895, Interlachen Academy was built; it is the oldest wooden school house in continuous use in Florida - now serving as the location of the Interlachen High School's JROTC program. In 1926,Interlachen first gained electricity and Route 14, now State Road 20,was constructed through Interlachen. In the 1930s a train came through the town every two hours. But in 1969, with the decline of railroads, the Interlachen Railroad depot was razed. Currently, a caboose sits in the middle of the town as a reminder of the tourist haven the town once was.
