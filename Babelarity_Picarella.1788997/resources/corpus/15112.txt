Born in Adelaide, South Australia to a Greek father and raised by his Greek mother and her Italian husband.
He signed his first professional contract with Newcastle United on 10 January 2007, keeping him at the club until June 2008. He did not make a first team appearance during his time at Newcastle, although he did feature on the bench for the first team in both Premier League and UEFA Cup matches.
He was on the fringes of Newcastle's senior side for the 2007–08 Premier League season and showed promising signs in pre-season friendlies, including getting two assists against Hartlepool United.
In January 2008, Troisi had a two match trial with Dutch Eredivisie club, Roda JC. Roda wanted to sign him on a permanent basis, but negotiations broke down as Troisi was a product of Newcastle's youth development and still under 23 years of age, so Newcastle would have required a compensation fee.
On 6 May 2008, it was announced that Troisi would leave Newcastle United after the end of the 2007/8 season.
He joined Gençlerbirliği S.K. at the end of August 2008 on a three-year contract. He made his debut for Gençlerbirliği S.K. on 14 September 2008 against Eskisehirspor at the 19 Mayis Stadium in Ankara, coming on as a 65th minutes substitute for Engin Baytar.

On 22 August 2012 Juventus F.C. signed him as free agent on a four-year contract, but half of the registration rights was sold to Atalanta for €2 million as part of Manolo Gabbiadini's deal on 24 August 2012. Norwich City manager Chris Hughton confirmed in a press conference that the club had made an enquiry into his availability.
On 24 September 2013, Troisi was loaned to Melbourne Victory on a one-year deal. He made his A-League debut against Melbourne Heart in Round 1 of the competition's ninth season. He scored his first goal for Melbourne in a 2-2 draw against Adelaide United. His second goal for Melbourne was in front of the home fans at Docklands Stadium in a 1-0 win over Brisbane Roar on 25 October 2013, thanks to an Archie Thompson through ball pass. He scored 2 goals against Wellington Phoenix in a 3-2 win, and his fifth came from a free kick against Sydney in a 2-3 loss. He scored 12 goals in the A-League and 3 in the Asian Champions League.
On 20 June 2014, Juventus announced that they had secured full ownership of Troisi's contract from Atalanta for €1 million, with Prince-Désir Gouano moved to Atalana also for €1 million.
On 30 August 2014, Troisi joined Belgian Pro League club Zulte Waregem on a one-year deal, after being deemed surplus to requirements at Juventus.
Troisi featured in over twenty Pro League matches, scoring five goals in the process, including a memorable long range strike against Club Brugge.
At the completion of his loan with Zulte, Troisi joined Ittihad FC of Saudi Arabia, severing ties with Juventus.
However, his stay was cut short . Troisi subsequently left the club via mutual termination.
Despite reported interest from A-League clubs, including his hometown club Adelaide United and Melbourne Victory, on 29 January 2016, Troisi signed with Chinese Super League side Liaoning Whowin joining fellow countryman Michael Thwaite.
After a successful 2006–07 season with the Newcastle reserve side, Troisi made his debut for the Australia U23 team (the "Olyroos"), on 18 April 2007 against Saudi Arabia in an Olympic qualifier. He followed up a good performance against the Saudis with a goal in the all-important clash with Iran in his hometown of Adelaide.
Troisi made his full international debut for Australia in a goalless friendly against Singapore on 22 March 2008, playing in left midfield.
Ange Postecoglou included Troisi in the Australia squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup,.
Troisi was named as part of Australia's 2015 AFC Asian Cup squad. He started Australia's first match of the tournament against Kuwait, scoring Australia's fourth and final goal of the match in the 92nd minute of the match, helping Australia to a 4-1 win.
