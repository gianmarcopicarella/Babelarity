Norway competed at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, United States. The nation enjoyed its best ever results in gold medals, most notably in the biathlon events, when Ole Einar Bjørndalen swept all four gold medals.
With 13 gold medals, Norway tied the Soviet Union at the 1976 Winter Olympics for most gold medals a country won at a Winter Olympics. However, Canada broke this record with 14 when they hosted the Vancouver games.
