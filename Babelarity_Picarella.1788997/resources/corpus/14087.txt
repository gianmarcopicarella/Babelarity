The National Division (Luxembourgish: Nationaldivisioun, French: Division Nationale, German: Nationaldivision) is the highest football league in Luxembourg. Until 2011, it was known as the BGL Ligue, after the Luxembourg Football Federation managed to seal a sponsorship deal with Fortis. Before 2006, it contained twelve teams, but it expanded to fourteen for the 2006–07 season, and it has maintained this number since. The current champions are F91 Dudelange.
The competition was first held in 1910, and has been held every year since, with the exceptions of 1913 and four seasons during the Second World War. The competition was called in Luxembourgish and French Lëtzebuerger Championnat / Championnat Luxembourgeois until 1913–14. From 1914–15 until 1931–32, the title was Éischt Divisioun / Première Division. It was called Éirendivisioun / Division d'Honneur from 1932–33 to 1956–57. Since the 1957–58 season, the competition has been called the Nationaldivisioun / Division Nationale.
RM Hamm Benfica, the 2014–15 Division of Honour champion, and UNA Strassen, which won the promotion play-off, were promoted to the top level for the first time in their history. Runner-up Racing FC rejoins the National Division just one year after their relegation.
