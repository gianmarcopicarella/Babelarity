The Upsilon meson (ϒ) is a quarkonium state (i.e. flavourless meson) formed from a bottom quark and its antiparticle. It was discovered by the E288 collaboration, headed by Leon Lederman, at Fermilab in 1977, and was the first particle containing a bottom quark to be discovered because it is the lightest that can be produced without additional massive particles. It has a lifetime of 6980120999999999999♠1.21×10−20 s and a mass about 7000946000000000000♠9.46 GeV/c2 in the ground state.
Oops-Leon, an erroneously-claimed discovery of a similar particle at a lower mass in 1976.
The ϕ particle is the analogous state made from strange quarks.
The J/ψ particle is the analogous state made from charm quarks.
