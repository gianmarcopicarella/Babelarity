The Warsaw Trade Tower (WTT) is one of the three (along with the Palace of Culture and Science and Warsaw Spire) buildings in Warsaw with a height greater than 200 metres. The Warsaw Trade Tower is currently the fourth tallest building in Poland.
The building is located on Ch≈Çodna and Towarowa streets, two blocks from the Warsaw Uprising Museum. The insurance company AXA is the name tenant, and its logo is prominently displayed from the upper floors.
The Warsaw Trade Tower has a metal spire (mast antenna relay) attached to the building on steel rims. The spire starts from a height of 32 floors and rises to a height of 24 m above the roof.
Construction took place from 1997 to 1999 by the Korean company Daewoo. In 2002, Daewoo sold the property to the American firm Apollo-Rida. At 208 metres in height (the main roof goes up to a height of 184 metres (604 feet)), the 43-storey skyscraper includes a two-story shopping centre, offices, and three floors of underground parking for 300 cars. The building has one of Europe's fastest elevators, travelling at a speed of 7 metres per second. The foundation of the Warsaw Trade Tower is 11 meters deep and is based on 156 piles.
