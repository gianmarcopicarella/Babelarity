Black Stone Cherry originated in Edmonton, Kentucky. Chris Robertson and John Fred Young, son of The Kentucky Headhunters's drummer Fred Young, started to play music together early in their teens and were soon joined by Wells and Lawhon. Black Stone Cherry officially formed on June 4, 2001. They then took over the practice house that had been used by The Kentucky Headhunters since 1968 and began to record tracks. They also began holding shows at clubs in the area, and after a short while they gained a large following of people of all ages in the town. In 2003, on Black Stone Cherry Records, the band released their first demo on CD called Rock N' Roll Tape.
The band's debut self-titled album was released in May 2006. After the band finished recording, they returned to Edmonton, invited by their former school principal, for a homecoming gig in the gym of the local middle school, which was attended by 1500 people. As the band entered the town, the streets were filled with people holding "welcome home" signs.
In July 2007, they released a second recording, an EP which contained the song "Rain Wizard" along with two previously unreleased tracks.
Their first live album was released on October 31, 2007. It was recorded at the Astoria in London, and copies were sold to the crowd immediately after the concert. The album is a strictly limited edition, and as of January 2013 mint copies were selling for Â£200 on Amazon.

The band supported Alter Bridge alongside Theory of a Deadman on a tour of Europe from October to November 2011. Cavo co-headlined a tour with Black Stone Cherry in February 2012 with Rains as support. The band also headlined their own UK tour (which sold out) supported by Rival Sons. They opened for Chickenfoot on their American tour in the spring of 2012.
Black Stone Cherry opened for Lynyrd Skynyrd and Bad Company on their co-headlining tour. The band headlined the second stage at Download Festival in June 2013. The band recorded a new album in fall 2013, through early 2014. Magic Mountain was released on 6 May 2014, reaching number five in the UK albums chart. The first single was "Me and Mary Jane". The single along with a selection of Black Stone Cherry's hits, exclusive acoustic tracks, and exclusive live tracks from Download Festival 2013 featured on a special CD: "Black Stone Cherry - Hits, Rarities & Live" which came as bonus content with the June 2014 edition of Classic Rock Magazine. Black Stone Cherry headlined a UK tour with Airbourne and Theory of a Deadman in October 2014, before embarking on a European tour.
The band took a break from touring due to private circumstances, except a one-off home show in December 2014 in Kentucky. The break ended when a US tour began in February 2015. In June, the band were the headliners of Download Festival's second stage, followed some supporting dates at smaller venues in the UK and Ireland.
