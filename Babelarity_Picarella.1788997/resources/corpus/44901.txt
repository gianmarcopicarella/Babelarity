Violent Revolution is the tenth studio album by the German thrash metal band Kreator. It was released on September 25, 2001. After almost a decade of musical experimentation with their metal sound (starting with Renewal), with this album the band returned to their 1980s thrash metal style, although it does make use of Gothenburg metal elements.
In 2005, Violent Revolution was ranked number 436 in Rock Hard magazine's book of The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time.
All songs written and composed by Mille Petrozza. 
The limited edition digipak (10000 copies) contains the bonus track "Violent Revolution" (Demo) (5:56).
