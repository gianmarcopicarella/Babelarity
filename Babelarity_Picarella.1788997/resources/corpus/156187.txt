Moore Haven is a city in Glades County, Florida, United States. The population was 1,680 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Glades County. Moore Haven is located on the southwest shoreline of Lake Okeechobee.
The community was named after James A. Moore, its founder. In its early days, Moore Haven was often called "Little Chicago", reflecting its status as a significant boom town. It was ideally located at the apex of Lake Okeechobee and the Caloosahatchee Canal.
The Great Miami Hurricane of 1926 dramatically altered the landscape of the area. The storm surge from the lake caused widespread death and destruction, sometimes literally relocating houses to the opposite side of the river. The town might have recovered, but it was hit not long after by the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane. This decimated areas that had escaped damage in 1926.
Today Moore Haven is a small, sleepy town that has little industry and infrastructure. Moore Haven is home to the Annual Chalo Nitka Festival, which is held the first weekend in March.
A large bridge that crosses the Caloosahatchee River was completed in the last 10 years. There are two access points to the Lake Okeechobee Scenic Trail, which passes through the town and around Lake Okeechobee.
