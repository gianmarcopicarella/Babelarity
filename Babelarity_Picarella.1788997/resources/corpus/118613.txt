Alpha Equulei (α Equ, α Equulei) is a star in the constellation Equuleus. It has the traditional name Kitalpha (rarely Kitel Phard or Kitalphar), a contraction of the Arabic name قطعة الفرس qiṭ‘a(t) al-faras "a piece of the horse".
In Chinese, 虚宿 (Xū Sù), meaning Emptiness, is an asterism consisting of α Equulei and β Aquarii. Consequently, α Equulei itself is known as 虛宿二 (Xū Sù èr, English: the Second Star of Emptiness.)
Alpha Equulei collectively belongs to spectral class G0III and has apparent magnitude +3.92 and a luminosity approximately 75 times that of the Sun. Alpha Equulei is a unique spectroscopic binary star consisting of two components. Kitalpha is approximately 186 light years from Earth.
This star has 2.72 times the mass of the Sun, with a projected rotational velocity of 20.0 km s−1 and an estimated rotation period of 98.8 days.
