Grand Island has been given the All-America City Award three times (1955, 1967, and 1981–82) by the National Civic League.
Grand Island is home to the Nebraska Law Enforcement Training Center (NLETC) which is the sole agency responsible for training law enforcement officers throughout the state, as well as the home of the Southern Power District serving southern Nebraska.
In 1857, 35 German settlers left Davenport, Iowa, and headed west to Nebraska to start a new settlement on an island known by French traders as La Grande Isle, which was formed by the Wood River and the Platte River. The settlers reached their destination on July 4, 1857, and by September had built housing using local timber. Over the next nine years, the settlers had to overcome many hardships, including blizzards and conflicts with Native Americans.
Surveyors from the Union Pacific Railroad laid out a town called Grand Island Station and many settlers living on Grand Island moved to the new town, located slightly inland from the island. In 1868 the railroad reached the area, bringing increased trade and business. By 1870, 1,057 people lived in the town and in 1872 the town was incorporated as Grand Island.
In about 1890, sugar beets were introduced as a crop in Nebraska. The first sugar beet processing factory in the United States was built in the southwest part of Grand Island.
On June 3, 1980, Grand Island was hit by a massive supercell storm. Through the course of the evening, the city was ravaged by seven tornadoes, the worst of which was rated F4 on the Fujita Scale. The hardest hit area of town was the South Locust business district. There were five deaths as a result of the tornadoes.
Tornado Hill is a local landmark created as a direct result of the tornadoes. Debris that could not be recycled was burnt near Fonner Park and buried within Ryder Park, on the west end of town. The base of the hill was a hole 6–8 feet deep and nearly 200 feet across, and the hill is 40 feet high. It is used for sledding in this naturally flat area.
A book, Night of the Twisters, by Ivy Ruckman, and movie were based on this event.

Construction of a primary water detention cell for flood control by the Central Platte River Natural Resources District, the city of Grand Island, Hall County and Merrick County has been delayed by slow clean up of burning grounds with buried and unexploded gravel mines on the former Cornhusker Army Ammunition Plant.
In 1981, a plume of contaminated groundwater was discovered beneath the former Ammunition Plant, which occupies 20 square miles west of Grand Island. The plume extended to northeast of the plant for about five miles and migrated towards Grand Island. RDX was discovered at 371 parts per billion (ppb) and TNT at 445 ppb on the plant site and just over 100 ppb off-site. The safe drinking water standard for RDX and TNT is 2 ppb. 
Cornhusker had produced bombs during World War II, the Korean War and Vietnam War and had been put on standby status in October 1973. During munition production, wastewater contaminated with explosives, and explosives-contaminated mops, buckets and other equipment were buried in 56 earthen surface impoundments. Dried solids were periodically scrapped from those impoundments and taken to the burning grounds for incineration and burial. After the discovery of contaminated groundwater in 1981, the Army extended Grand Island city water lines to rural subdivisions (that as of 2014 are part of the Capital Heights and Le Heights areas) in 1985, because well water may have exposed residents to contaminated water. In 1987, the Army burnt about 40,000 tons of explosives-contaminated soil. In 1993, city water lines in northwest and north central Grand Island were extended. In 1998, a pump-and-treat facility that continues to operate was built to cycle contaminated water through an explosives-removal system and discharge it as clean water into Silver Creek. The Army injected “hot spots” of contamination with a molasses-based substance to help degrade RDX and TNT with bacteria present under T&E cattle company feedlot more quickly, which allegedly helped lower contamination levels. In the late 1990s and early 2000s the bomb production line sites (the so-called load line structures), were cleared and burnt. As of 2014, TNT is still present at 30 ppb for and 7 ppb for RDX in the hot spot under load line 1.
As of 2014, the most heavily contaminated areas at Cornhusker are the burning grounds with buried and unexploded gravel mines. Their excavation proceeds very slowly, sifting one cubic yard at a time, because of the explosives' shock sensitivity. Excavation is expected to finish by January 2015, followed by environmental testing, estimated to take 24 to 36 months.
In 2010 Grand Island became the home of the Nebraska State Fair.
Interstate 80 is located four miles south of the city. US Highway 281 is the main north-south route in the city, running through the city's west edge south to Hastings, Nebraska, and north to O'Neill, Nebraska.
Central Nebraska Regional Airport is located in Grand Island. On September 4, 2008, Allegiant Air began nonstop service from Grand Island to Las Vegas, Nevada. In June 2011, American Eagle Airlines began providing service to Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas twice daily.
Grand Island used to have a trolley that ran just east of the Grand Island College (now the location of Grand Island Senior High School). The trolley ran from the intersection of Capital Avenue and Lafayette Avenue, south to Waugh Street. It turned east on Waugh Street, and ran to Grand Island Avenue. It then turned south on Grand Island Avenue and ran where a median is now located. The trolley line terminated at the Grand Island Avenue and 13th Street intersection. The trolley line was used as a "school bus" for college students to get to the former college.
