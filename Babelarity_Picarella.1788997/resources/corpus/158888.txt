Punta de Tarifa (Point Tarifa, Point Marroqui) is the southernmost point of the Iberian Peninsula and continental Europe. It is located in the province of CÃ¡diz and the autonomous community of Andalusia on the Atlantic end of the Straits of Gibraltar. The coast of Morocco can be seen from this point.
The point is the southeastern tip of the former island, known as Isla de Tarifa or Isla de Las Palomas, located offshore and connected by the mainland with a causeway. The island was occupied by a military installation between the 1930s and 2001.
The name of Tarifa, both for the island and for the municipality, originates from Tarif ibn Malik, who in 710 started here the Islamic conquest of Spain.
