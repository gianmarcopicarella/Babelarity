Ybbs an der Donau (German pronunciation: [ˈɪps]) is a city in Austria. It was established in 1317. Throughout the town, from the intersection of the important trade routes and along the Danube the town has preserved a site that already had great economic importance during the Middle Ages. This is the reason for the very early award of incorporation as a town.
