Artur Guilherme Moraes Gusmão (born 25 January 1981), best known as Artur, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Turkish club Osmanlıspor.
Artur started his career at Paulista. In 2003 he was loaned, and later signed, to Cruzeiro, in 2003. For the 2006 and 2007 season, he was loaned to Coritiba. He was the first choice keeper in 2006 season, ahead Kleber and Rodrigo. In 2007 season Édson Bastos became the first choice.
On 4 January 2008, Artur signed a two-year contract with Siena after his contract with Cruzeiro had expired. On 30 January, he was loaned to Cesena.
On 25 June 2008, Artur completed a transfer to Roma from Siena with his team mate Simone Loria in an exchange deal which had Roma goalkeeper Gianluca Curci move to Siena in a co-ownership deal and Roma midfielder Ahmed Barusso loaned to the Tuscan-based club. Daniele Galloppa, owned by Roma and Siena, became in effect a Siena player as part of the deal. He made his unofficial debut in the first pre-season friendly of Roma, when they suffered a 3–1 defeat to Steaua Bucharest.
In April 2009, he became first choice after the injury of Doni, ahead Júlio Sérgio and Pietro Pipolo. In the 2009–10 season, he was dropped; the coach preferred that Júlio Sérgio as first choice, and Bogdan Lobonţ and Doni as backup.
In summer 2010, he left for Braga, as the club lost Eduardo and Paweł Kieszek. He was the backup of Mário Felgueiras as the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League third qualifying round as new signing Quim injured. He then became Felipe's understudy ahead Marcos. After Felipe returned to Brazil in December, he became the first choice.
On 16 May 2011, Artur signed a four-year deal with Benfica. He played consistently throughout his first season with the Eagles, earning the nickname "King Artur".
In 2012–13, Artur's performances worsened with various mistakes against Porto, Estoril Praia, and in the Portuguese Cup final defeat by Vitória Guimarães. Despite this, manager Jorge Jesus maintained his confidence on him.
After a string of mistakes midway through the 2013–14 campaign, Jorge Jesus dropped him in favour of Oblak, and the latter went on to keep several clean sheets in his first starts, notably in a 2–0 home win against Porto. He ended the season in the bench, and was told to look for a new club.
After Oblak's departure, Artur regained his place in the starting eleven in the Supertaça, being an important part in the victory over Rio Ave, defending 3 penalties in the shootout. On 31 August 2014, in a Lisbon derby, Artur made a mistake, by giving the ball away to Islam Slimani who scored the equalizer. On 16 September 2014, in the first matchday of Champions League, against Zenit, he was sent off in the eighteenth minute for a professional foul on Danny outside of the box.
On 30 June 2015, he left Benfica as his contract expired.
On 11 July 2015, Artur signed a two-year contract with Turkish club Osmanlıspor.
