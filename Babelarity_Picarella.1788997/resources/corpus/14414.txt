Julien Boutter (born 7 April 1974) is a former professional male tennis player from France.
At the 2002 Australian Open, Boutter defeated No. 2 seed and former World No. 1 Gustavo Kuerten, despite being down two sets, 3–6, 4–6, 7–5, 6–3, 6–3.
In his career he won one singles title (2003 Casablanca) and reached the final in Milan (2001) but lost to Swiss Roger Federer. He reached two Master Series quarterfinals at Hamburg in 2002 and Monte Carlo in 2003. Boutter also reached the semi-finals of the 2002 Australian Open partnering fellow Frenchman Arnaud Clément, only to lose to Michaël Llodra and Fabrice Santoro 3–6, 6–3, 10–12. During the match, Boutter led an impromptu funeral ceremony for a bird inadvertently hit by Llodra as it was chasing a moth.
