Berry is a region located in the center of France. It was a province of France until the provinces were replaced by départements on 4 March 1790.
The Berry region now consists of the départements of Cher, Indre and parts of Vienne. The capital of Berry was Bourges. Berry is notable as the birthplace of several kings and other members of the French royal family. In the Middle Ages it was the centre of the Duchy of Berry. It is also known for an illuminated manuscript produced in the 14th–15th century called Les Très riches heures du Duc de Berry.
Of old, La Brenne was a region in the old provinces of Berry and Touraine, west of Châteauroux and east of Tournon-Saint-Martin.
