§ 2. The master of papal liturgical celebrations is appointed by the Supreme Pontiff to a five-year term of office; papal masters of ceremonies who assist him in sacred celebrations are likewise appointed by the secretary of state to a term of the same length.

As well as assisting the Pope at sacred functions the Papal Master of Ceremonies also assists Cardinals on various occasions: during Consistories, when taking possession of his Titular Church, and during solemn celebrations of Mass or other important religious services. When a Cardinal is created at a consistory, the Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations assigns one of the Office's Masters of Ceremonies to him.
