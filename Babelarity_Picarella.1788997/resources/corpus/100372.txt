He joined the opposition in November 2007. After Sogavare was defeated on 13 December 2007 in a motion of no-confidence, which was put forward by Sikua, Sikua was the opposition's candidate to replace him.

On 15 December 2014, following a general election, he was appointed Minister for Education and Human Resources by new Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare.
