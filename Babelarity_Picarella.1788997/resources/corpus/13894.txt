Sweden's European championship debut came at EuroBasket 1953 in Moscow. The Swedes did not fare well in their first tournament, losing all 7 games to finish in last place of the 17 teams.
Sweden's first EuroBasket win came against Luxembourg in the preliminary round of EuroBasket 1955 in Budapest. They lost three in that round as well, however, and took 4th of the 5 teams and found themselves in the classification rounds. They again finished the pool with a 1–3 record, defeating Denmark. Two losses in the classification 13–16 semifinals and the 15/16 final (a rematch against Luxembourg) put Sweden at 16th place of the 18 teams.
Sweden qualified for the final round of the EuroBasket on more occasions and earned some more victories but the squad lacked the depth to become a serious medal contender. At some events, however, the country displayed potential. E.g. at the 2013 EuroBasket it beat the heavily favored former champion Russia by 19 points difference (81-62).
