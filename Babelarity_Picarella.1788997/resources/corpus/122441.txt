Gamma (uppercase Œì, lowercase Œ≥; Greek: ŒìŒ¨ŒºŒºŒ± G√°mma) is the third letter of the Greek alphabet. In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 3. In Ancient Greek, gamma represented a voiced velar stop /…°/. In Modern Greek, it represents a voiced fricative.
Based on its phonetic value in Modern Greek, gamma has also been introduced in a number of modern Latin-alphabet based phonetic notations (Latin (or latinized) gamma ∆î).
The Greek letter Gamma Œì was derived from the Phoenician letter for the /g/ phoneme (ê§Ç gƒ´ml), and as such is cognate with Hebrew gimel ◊í. Based on its name, the letter has been interpreted as an abstract representation of a camel's neck, but this has been criticized as contrived, and it is more likely that the letter is derived from an Egyptian hieroglyph representing a club or throwing stick.
In the archaic period, the shape of gamma was closer to a classical lambda (Œõ), while lambda retained the Phoenician L-shape (êåã).
Letters that arose from the Greek gamma include Etruscan (Old Italic) êåÇ, Roman C and G, Runic kaunan ·ö≤, Gothic geuua êå≤, the Coptic ‚≤Ñ, and the Cyrillic letters –ì and “ê.
The Ancient Greek /g/ phoneme was the voiced velar stop, continuing the PIE voiced velar and palatal stops *g, *«µ.
The modern Greek phoneme represented by gamma is realized either as a palatal / ù/ (before a front vowel, /e, i/), or as a velar /…£/ (in all other environments). Both in Ancient and in Modern Greek, before other velars (Œ∫, œá, Œæ k, kh, ks), gamma represents a velar nasal /≈ã/. A double gamma Œ≥Œ≥ represents the sequence /≈ã…°/ (phonetically varying [≈ã…°~…°]) or /≈ã…£/.
Lowercase Greek gamma is used in the Americanist phonetic notation and Uralic Phonetic Alphabet to indicate voiced consonants. In International Phonetic Alphabet, it represents the voiced velar fricative.
In these contexts, gamma is considered as an addition to Latin alphabet, the so-called Latin or latinized gamma …£ (with an upper-case variant ∆î based on the minuscule).
Latin gamma is used to represent a voiced velar fricative, both in the International Phonetic Alphabet, and in the alphabets of African languages such as Dagbani, Dinka, Kabiy√©, and Ewe, some Berber languages using the Berber Latin alphabet, and sometimes in the romanization of Pashto.
Lowercase Latin gamma is used in the International Phonetic Alphabet to represent the voiced velar fricative. A lowercase Latin gamma that lies above the baseline rather than crossing it (…§) represents the close-mid back unrounded vowel. In certain nonstandard variations of the IPA the uppercase form is used.
