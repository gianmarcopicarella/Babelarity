1749 Telamon, provisional designation 1949 SB, is a carbonaceous asteroid, about 80 kilometers in diameter. It is a Jupiter Trojan that shares the orbit of the gas giant Jupiter. It was discovered by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at Heidelberg Observatory on 23 September 1949.
The C-type Trojan asteroid dwells in the so-called Greek Camp – the L4 Lagrangian point of the Sun–Jupiter system. It therefore orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.6–5.7 AU once every 11 years and 8 months (4,267 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.11 and is tilted by 6 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. It has an albedo of 0.06–0.07, based on observations by the Akari and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer satellites.
Photometric observations of the body from 1995 were used to build a light-curve rendering a rotation period of 11.2 hours with a brightness variation of 6999100000000000000♠0.1±0.01 in magnitude, while another observation in 2010 rendered a period of 16.9 hours.
The asteroid was named by the discoverer after Telamon, from Greek mythology, who was an argonaut searching for the Golden Fleece, and father of Ajax and Teucer, after whom the minor planets 1404 Ajax and 2797 Teucer are named. Telamon banished his son Teucer (as he had been banished by his own father) when he returned home from the Trojan war without the remains of his brother.
