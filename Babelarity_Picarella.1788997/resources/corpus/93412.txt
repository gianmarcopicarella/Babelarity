The spot-billed toucanet (Selenidera maculirostris) is a species of bird in the Ramphastidae family. It is found in the Atlantic Forest of south-eastern Brazil, far eastern Paraguay, and far north-eastern Argentina (Misiones). It is 35 cm (14 in) long and weighs 140-200 grams (4.9-7.1 oz.) Except for the bill-pattern, it resembles the Gould's toucanet, and the two have been considered conspecific in the past.
