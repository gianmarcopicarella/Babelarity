1857 Parchomenko, provisional designation 1971 QS1, is a stony asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt. It was discovered by Russian astronomer Tamara Smirnova at Crimean Astrophysical Observatory in Nauchnyj on 30 August 1971.
The S-type asteroid measures about 9 kilometers in diameter. Observations in 2006 suggested that it may be binary asteroid. However, no new findings have been made since. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.9–2.5 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,228 days). Parchomenko has a rotation period of 3.1 hours and a geometric albedo of 6999295200000000000♠0.2952±0.0580 and 0.20, according to the NEOWISE mission and assumption made by the LCDB project, respectively.
It was named in honor of female astronomer Praskoviya Georgievna Parchomenko (1886–1970), who observed and discovered several minor planets such as 1129 Neujmina and 1166 Sakuntala, at the Crimean Simeiz Observatory during the 1930s and 1940s.
