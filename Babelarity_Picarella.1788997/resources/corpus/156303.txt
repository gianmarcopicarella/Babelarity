Klöntalersee is a natural lake in the canton of Glarus, Switzerland and covers the major part of the Klöntal valley floor. Since 1908, it has been used as a reservoir for electricity production. The dam's construction substantially increased the lake's volume.
Klöntalersee is drained by the Löntsch, a left tributary of the Linth.
