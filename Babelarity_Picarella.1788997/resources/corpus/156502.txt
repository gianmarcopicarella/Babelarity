Keokuk County is a county located in the U.S. state of Iowa. As of the 2010 census, the population was 10,511. The county seat is Sigourney.
Keokuk County was formed in 1837. It was named for the eponymous chief of the Sac Indians, who advocated peace with the white settlers. In May 1843, the county opened for public settlement and was self-governed from 1844. Previously it was governed by Washington County. After a debate lasting a few years for the location for the county seat, the right went to Sigourney in 1856.
