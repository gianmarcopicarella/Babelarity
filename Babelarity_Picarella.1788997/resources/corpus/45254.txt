White Trash, Two Heebs and a Bean is the fourth studio album by the American punk rock band NOFX. It was released on November 5, 1992 through Epitaph Records. It is the first NOFX album to feature El Hefe on guitar, replacing Steve Kidwiller, who left the band in 1991. White Trash, Two Heebs and a Bean was also the first NOFX album not produced by Brett Gurewitz, who produced the band's first three albums. According to the Liner notes for the album, the original title was going to be "White Trash, Two Kykes and a Spic" but one of the band members' grandma thought it was offensive, so they changed it to the title of the actual release.
All songs were written by Fat Mike except "Straight Edge", originally by Minor Threat.
