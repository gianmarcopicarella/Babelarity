The luminosity class II in the Yerkes spectral classification is given to bright giants. These are stars which straddle the boundary between ordinary giants and supergiants, and the classification is in general given to giant stars with exceptionally high luminosity, but which are not sufficiently bright or massive to be classified as supergiants.
Well known stars which are classified as bright giants include:
Epsilon Canis Majoris (Adhara): a blue-white (B-type) bright giant
Omicron Scorpii: a white (A-type) bright giant
Theta Scorpii (Sargas): a white (F-type) bright giant
Beta Draconis: a yellow (G-type) bright giant
Beta Capricorni (Dabih): an orange (K-type) bright giant
Alpha Herculis (Rasalgethi): a red (M-type) bright giant
Gamma Canis Majoris (Muliphein) a (B-Type) bright giant
