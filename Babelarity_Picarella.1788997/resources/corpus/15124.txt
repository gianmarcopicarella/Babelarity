Avdija Vršajević (born 6 March 1986) is a Bosnian professional footballer who plays as a right back for Turkish club Osmanlıspor.
Vršajević's first professional club was NK TOŠK Tešanj. Here he spent the 2003-04 season before moving to Željezničar. He spent only one season at Željezničar before Čelik Zenica acquired his services. He remained at Čelik for two seasons, often in and out of the first team.
From Čelik, Avdija moved to Czech side AC Sparta Prague but never made an appearance for them, spending loan spells initially at SK Kladno and then at 1. FC Tatran Prešov. Tatran made his loan move permanent in 2009 and he spent the following two seasons there, making 60 appearances and scoring three goals. He was played as either a right back or a right winger at Tatran.
Avdija moved back to Čelik in 2011, spending one season at the club where he made a further 21 appearances.
As he only signed a one-year contract at Čelik and chose not to renew it when the season ended, Avdija moved to Croatian side Hajduk Split, signing a three-year contract. He made his debut for Hajduk on the 22nd of July, 2012 in a 0–0 draw against Istra. Immediately becoming the club's first choice right back, Avdija made 30 appearances in all competitions in his first season at Hajduk. In the 2013–14 season, manager Igor Tudor changed his role in the team often. Throughout the season he found himself at left back, right back and right wing, once again making 30 appearances in all competitions.
In June 2015, Vršajević left Hajduk Split, after agreeing mutual termination with the club.
On July 18, he signed with newly promoted Turkish side Osmanlıspor.
In 2006, Vršajević was called to Bosnia and Herzegovina under-21 side by then coach Ibrahim Zukanović.
