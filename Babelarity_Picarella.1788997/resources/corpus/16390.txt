Pablo Hernández Domínguez (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈpaβlo erˈnandeθ]; born 11 April 1985) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for Qatari club Al-Arabi as a winger.
In a spell which also included two loans, he played the early part of his career with Valencia, appearing in 173 official games (25 goals). He also competed two years in Wales, with Swansea City.
Hernández represented Spain at the 2009 Confederations Cup.
Born in Castellón de la Plana, Castellón, Valencian Community, Hernández was a product of Valencia CF's youth system (operating as striker in the B-team). He made his debuts with the main squad on the last matchday of 2005–06, playing 20 minutes in a 1–2 away loss against CA Osasuna. Midway through the following season, he was loaned to Segunda División side Cádiz CF.
In July 2007, Valencia included Hernández in the transfer that brought Alexis from Getafe CF to Mestalla, but would re-buy him for €1 million in July 2008, subsequently signing the player to a six-year contract.
Hernández scored his first goal for Valencia on 27 November 2008, in a 4–0 win over Rosenborg BK for the campaign's UEFA Cup, after an individual effort. After having subbed in for Rubén Baraja in the second half of a home fixture against Recreativo de Huelva, he netted his second goal and first in the league, in a 1–1 draw in March 2009; the following month, also as a replacement but now for Joaquín, he added his third, in a 3–1 home win over Sevilla FC – deep into injury time, against ten men.
On 25 April 2009, this time as a starter, Hernández fired the hosts into the 2–1 lead against FC Barcelona, following a run between four players and a one-two with Juan Mata. The match ended 2–2.
Hernández scored the second goal in 2009–10's opener, against Sevilla in a 2–0 home triumph. Fully established in the starting XI now over Joaquín, he continued to produce fine displays in this season, including a 40-meter lob against UD Almería in a 3–0 away success.
Hernández scored twice against Club Brugge KV in extra time of the UEFA Europa League round-of-32 second leg game played at the Mestalla Stadium on 25 February 2010, for a 3–0 win (3–1 aggregate). In the 2010–11 season, he continued battling with Joaquín for first-choice status; on 7 December 2010, he netted at Old Trafford against Manchester United for the UEFA Champions League, putting the Che 1–0 up at half-time in an eventual 1–1 group stage draw.
Hernández moved to Premier League side Swansea City on 31 August 2012, for three years and a club-record fee of £5.55 million. He scored his first official goal against Wigan Athletic on 20 October, helping to a 2–1 home win.
Hernández netted his second goal for the Swans on 3 November, scoring a late equaliser in a 1–1 draw against Chelsea at the Liberty Stadium. He was named to the team of the week published on 3 September by Sky Sports, and started in the final of the Football League Cup on 24 February 2013, helping to a 5–0 routing of Bradford City.
On 15 July 2014, Hernández joined Al-Arabi SC on a three-year deal, having started talks with the Qatari club the previous week. The fee was unknown, but it was speculated that the fee would be lower than the amount paid by Swansea to Valencia for his services two years before.
After a loan spell at Al-Nasr Dubai SC, Hernández returned to Spain and its top level on 31 August 2015, after agreeing to a one-year loan deal with Rayo Vallecano. He started regularly for the team from the Madrid outskirts, who ended the campaign with relegation.
After close observation by Spanish national team manager Luis Aragonés during his time at Getafe, Hernández was picked for the 32-man provisional squad for UEFA Euro 2008, but did not make the final cut. On 5 June 2009, he was called to represent the country at the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup in South Africa, as a replacement for injured Andrés Iniesta, by new boss Vicente del Bosque; he gained his first cap on the 20th, coming on as a substitute for club teammate David Villa in the 60th minute of the last group stage match, a 2–0 success against the hosts.
Hernández scored his first international goal on 18 November 2009, playing the entire second half of the 5–1 friendly win in Austria and closing the scoresheet.
