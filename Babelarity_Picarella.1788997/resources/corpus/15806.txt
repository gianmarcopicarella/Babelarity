The 2012–13 Primera División season was the 122nd season of top-flight professional football in Argentina. It started on August 3, 2012 and ended on June 29, 2013. Twenty teams competed in the league, eighteen returning from the 2011–12 season and two promoted from the Primera B Nacional Championship (Championship winners River Plate and runners-up Quilmes). The two promoted clubs avoided relegation.
In the first half of the season Vélez Sarsfield became champion of the 2012 Torneo Inicial "Eva Perón", winning the “Evita Capitana” League Cup. In the second one Newell's Old Boys clinched the 2013 Torneo Final "Eva Perón", winning the “Juana Azurduy” League Cup.
In the Superfinal Vélez Sarsfield were crowned Argentina’s Super champions after a 1-0 victory over Newell’s Old Boys in Mendoza. This was the first overall league championship play-off in Argentina since 1991 when Newell’s defeated Boca Juniors on penalties.
Independiente was relegated, for first time, to the Primera B Nacional Championship. The other relegated teams were San Martín (SJ) and Unión.
The champion of the Torneo Inicial and Torneo Final met in a season ending championship final to determine the super champion. The format for each tournament remained the same as in previous seasons.
Relegation was also changed for the season. Instead of two teams facing direct relegation to the Primera B Nacional, three teams were directly relegated. The promotion/relegation playoffs were eliminated.
The teams ending the 2011–12 season in the bottom two places of the relegation table were Banfield and Olimpo. They played in the 2012–13 Primera B Nacional Championship. At the same time the 2011–12 Primera B Nacional Championship winners River Plate and runners-up Quilmes were directly promoted at the end of the season. San Lorenzo and San Martín (SJ) remained in the Primera División winning their Relegation/promotion playoffs to Instituto and Rosario Central.
The Torneo Inicial was the first tournament of the season. It began on August 3, 2012 and ended on February 13, 2013.
