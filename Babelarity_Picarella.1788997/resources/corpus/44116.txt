Franz "Franzl" Lang (28 December 1930 – 6 December 2015), known as the Yodelking (German: Jodlerkönig), was a yodeler from Bavaria, Germany. Lang also sang and played the guitar and the accordion and was the author of several books on yodeling. Lang's genre is German folk music; he typically sang in the Bavarian dialect of the rural Alpine regions.
By general consensus, Lang was considered to be the best Alpine yodeler in the world.

For many years in the 1970s, he was a permanent feature of musical variety shows on West German television, especially on the ZDF program Lustige Musikanten.
Lang has sold more than 10 million recordings; he has earned 20 gold records and one platinum record within the German recording industry. He was known as one of the most famous yodelers to have ever lived.
