The Emblem of Ethiopia has been in its current form since 1996. It contains a yellow interlaced pentagram radiating rays of light on a blue shield. Today, the pentagram stands for the unity of the people and the nationality of Ethiopia.
The emblem also appears on the centre of the flag of Ethiopia.
Prior to 1975, there was a coat of arms for the Ethiopian Empire.
In 1975, an earlier version of the emblem of Ethiopia was adopted, consisting of a plow on a yellow sunburst surrounded by a wreath. It was associated with the Derg regime.
