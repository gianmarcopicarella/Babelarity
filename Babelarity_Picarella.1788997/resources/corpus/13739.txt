The 1984 San Marino Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Imola on May 6, 1984. It was the fourth round of the 1984 Formula One season.
This was the only Formula One race for which Ayrton Senna failed to qualify. Toleman decided not to run both cars during Friday qualifying due to a dispute with tyre supplier Pirelli. Senna then suffered a fuel pressure problem in the wet Saturday session and did not have enough time for it to be fixed to allow him to make the grid.
The Tyrrells of Brundle (finished 10th) and Bellof (finished 5th) were both later disqualified from all the season's races for technical infringements.
Note: Only the top five positions are included for both sets of standings. Points accurate at final declaration of results. Tyrrell and its drivers were subsequently disqualified from 1984 results and their points reallocated.
