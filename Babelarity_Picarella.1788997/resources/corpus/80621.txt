Corin "Corky" Nemec (born Joseph Charles Nemec IV; November 5, 1971) is an American actor, producer, and screenwriter. Nemec is known for playing the title character on Parker Lewis Can't Lose, Jonas Quinn on Stargate SG-1, and Harold Lauder in the ABC miniseries The Stand.
Nemec's mother was a graphic artist as well as a painter, writer, and poet. His father, Joseph Charles Nemec, works in the film industry as a set designer and production designer. His older sister Anastacia C. Nemec works also as an assistant director
He is close friends with actor David Faustino of Married... with Children, with whom he has a production company and is co-starring in Star-ving, a webseries spoofing HBO's Entourage and airing on Crackle.
Nemec was inspired to become an actor after watching the children's film The Goonies at the age of 13, for which his father had done the art direction. He also cites his parents' artistic professions as a major influence, and that acting "seemed the right thing to do". Nemec began training with the Centre Stage LA theatre company and signed on with an agent after performing in one of their talent showcases. He was booked for several commercials such as Suzuki and eventually landed a guest-spot on the TV show Sidekicks starring Ernie Reyes, Jr., with whom Nemec is still friends today. His first major film role was Tucker: The Man and His Dream in 1988. He appeared in several TV shows, earning an Emmy nomination for his portrayal of Steven Stayner in the television film I Know My First Name Is Steven. He starred alongside legendary actors Jack Palance, Peter Boyle and Charlton Heston in the 1990 feature film Solar Crisis.
Nemec played the lead in the TV series Parker Lewis Can't Lose from 1990 to 1993. Also, in 1993, Nemec was cast as Harold Lauder in a TV adaptation of Stephen King's The Stand. In 1997, he played a notable role in the movie Goodbye, America. He also starred in the TV movies My Brother's Keeper alongside Jeanne Tripplehorn and "Blackout" with Jane Seymour. Nemec has made appearances on several TV shows, including Tales from the Crypt, Smallville, CSI: NY, CSI: Miami, Supernatural, and Ghost Whisperer. He also portrayed the serial killers Richard Speck and Ted Bundy. He played leading parts in some original Sci Fi Channel (United States) made TV-movies as Sea Beast, Mansquito, SS Doomtrooper, and "Dragon Wasps".
During the 1990s, Nemec had a brief foray into hip-hop, recording an entire album with the group Starship of Foolz (one of the members was Shane Mooney, the son of comedian Paul Mooney), developed by Matt Robinson and Dedra Tate, and produced by actor Balthazar Getty. He produced a new comic series starring Paul Mooney (comedian) as the president of the United States. He also appeared in the music video Beer for My Horses by Toby Keith and Willie Nelson.
From 2002 to 2004, he appeared as Jonas Quinn on Stargate SG-1, temporarily replacing Michael Shanks (Daniel Jackson) in the line-up of the SG-1 team.
In January 2013, while working on the film Poseidon Rex, Nemec was involved in a boating accident in which, while being transported to set, the Belizean Coast Guard ran into a semi-submerged barge. His leg was shattered and he required multiple blood transfusions to save his life.
