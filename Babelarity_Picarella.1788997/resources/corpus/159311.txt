Zannone is an island in the Tyrrhenian Sea off the west coast of Italy, and is part of the Pontine Islands, administratively in the comune of Ponza. The entire island is about 1 square kilometre (0.4 square miles) in size and about 10 km (6 mi) from Ponza Island.
It is part of the Circeo National Park because of its beauty and several rare biomes. The island is uninhabited but supervised by the Forestry Service, which maintains a station and small educational exhibit on top of Monte Pellegrino, the highest point on the island. There are also ruins of a Benedictine convent dating to the 13th century. However, there are no tourist facilities and camping or overnight stays are prohibited although no special permit is required to visit the island.
