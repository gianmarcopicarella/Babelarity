Ivan Močinić (born 30 April 1993) is a Croatian football player currently playing for SK Rapid Wien in Austrian Football Bundesliga.
Močinić is versatile and can play as a defensive, box-to-box or attacking midfielder.
Močinić made his début for Rijeka, age 18, in an away match against Dinamo Zagreb in October 2011. During his first professional season he collected 13 caps. Močinić scored his first goal for Rijeka in the last round of 2011–12 Prva HNL, against NK Karlovac 1919. During the following four seasons, he has been a regular starter on most occasions, collecting 140 appearances in the league, domestic cup and Europe. Močinić performed most consistently during the 2013–14 season when his solid performances earned him 47 appearances in all competitions. He particularly impressed in Rijeka's triumph over Dinamo Zagreb in the 2014 Croatian Football Cup Final. Močinić was team captain for the first time in the away loss to Dinamo Zagreb on 12 April 2014. During the 2015–16 season, he had more starts as team captain than any other team-mate.
During the 2015 winter transfer window, numerous clubs expressed interest in signing Močinić, namely Dinamo Zagreb, Newcastle United, Celtic, Rubin Kazan, Lazio, Sampdoria, Atalanta, Carpi, Bordeaux and Olympiacos. However, HNK Rijeka rejected several offers and Močinić stayed with the club.
On 16 July 2016, both the Austrian and Croatian press reported that Močinić agreed terms with SK Rapid Wien, with the transfer valued at €2.5 million.
Močinić earned 21 caps for Croatia's U19, U20 and U21 sides, including three caps at the 2012 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship. His impressive performances in the first half of 2014 earned him a first call-up for the Croatia national football team. He was originally included in the 2014 FIFA World Cup squad for Croatia, but a last minute injury forced him out of the tournament. On 17 November 2015, Močinić made a senior national team début for Croatia in an away win against Russia, when he played the entire match.
