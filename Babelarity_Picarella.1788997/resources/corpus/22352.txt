The Engishiki (延喜式, "Procedures of the Engi Era") is a Japanese book about laws and customs. The major part of the writing was completed in 927.
In 905, Emperor Daigo ordered the compilation of the Engishiki. Although previous attempts at codification are known to have taken place, neither the Konin nor the Jogan Gishiki survive making the Engishiki important for early Japanese historical and religious studies.
Fujiwara no Tokihira began the task, but work stalled when he died four years later in 909. His brother Fujiwara no Tadahira continued the work in 912 eventually completing it in 927.
After a number of revisions, the work was used as a basis for reform starting in 967.
The text is 50 volumes in lengths and is organized by department:
volumes 1–10: Department of Worship In addition to regulating ceremonials and worship at the Ise Grand Shrine, this section of the Engishiki recorded liturgical texts, listed all 2,861 Shinto shrines existing at the time, and listed the 3,131 official-recognized and enshrined Kami. Felicia Gressitt Brock published a two-volume annotated English language translation with an introduction entitled Engi-shiki; procedures of the Engi Era in 1970.
volumes 11–40: Department of State and Eight Ministries
volumes 41–49: Other departments
volume 50: Miscellaneous laws
