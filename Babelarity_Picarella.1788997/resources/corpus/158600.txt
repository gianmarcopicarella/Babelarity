Webster County is a county located in the west central portion of the U.S. state of Georgia. As of the 2010 Census reflected a population of 2,799, making it the third-least populous county in Georgia. The county seat is Preston.
Webster County was created by an act of the Georgia General Assembly on December 16, 1853, as Kinchafoonee County. A subsequent legislative act on February 21, 1856, changed the name to Webster. The land for the county came from portions of Stewart County.
The County is named for Daniel Webster, U.S. representative of New Hampshire and U.S. representative and U.S. senator of Massachusetts. Webster County's original name of Kinchafoonee came from the Kinchafoonee Creek which runs through the county.
