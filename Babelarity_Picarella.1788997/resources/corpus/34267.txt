Hermann August Theodor Harms (16 July 1870, in Berlin – 27 November 1942, in Berlin) was a German taxonomist and botanist.
Harms worked as a botanist at the Botanical Museum in Berlin. He was a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences.
He was longtime editor of Adolf Engler's "Das Pflanzenreich", and was the author of several chapters on various plant families in Engler and Prantl's "Die Natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien", including the chapter on Bromeliaceae (1930).
In 1938 he revised the pitcher plant genus Nepenthes, dividing it into three subgenera: Anurosperma, Eunepenthes and Mesonepenthes. Furthermore, he was interested in the genus Passiflora.
The plant genera Harmsia (Schum.) and Harmsiella (Briq.) commemorate his name.
