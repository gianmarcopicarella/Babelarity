The Luxembourgian national basketball team is the basketball team that represents Luxembourg in international competitions.
Luxembourg's first European championship appearance was at the EuroBasket 1946. They found themselves heavily over-matched in the preliminary round, being outscored by 113 points over three games. They ranked last place in the group of four. The semifinal round, which was essentially a 7th–10th place classification round for Luxembourg, saw their first win. They defeated England 50–27. This advanced them to a playoff for 7th and 8th places; they were defeated by Belgium to finish 8th out of the ten team competition.
Luxembourg competed at the EuroBasket 1951 competition in Paris. They lost all four of their preliminary round games, putting them fifth place in their group of 5. Since they were seeded into a group of five teams rather than a group of four teams (the 18 teams were divided into 4 groups, 2 groups with 5 teams and 2 groups with 4 teams), Luxembourg had to play an elimination game against Denmark for the right to advance into the classification rounds. The winner could potentially place as high as 9th; the loser was relegated to 17th place.
Luxembourg was able to get a final half-court shot off before time expired, but the ball bounced off the rim and the team was served their fifth and final loss of the tournament.
The EuroBasket 1955 in Budapest was where Luxembourg next appeared. They lost all four preliminary round games, and were relegated to the classification rounds. In the first round, Luxembourg was able to win 2 games, finishing third in the group. They lost their 13–16 semifinal, but won the 15/16 final to finish 15th out of 18 teams.
