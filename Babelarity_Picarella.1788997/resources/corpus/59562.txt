Lithium sulfide is the inorganic compound with the formula Li2S. It crystallizes in the antifluorite motif, described as the salt (Li+)2S2−. It forms a solid yellow-white deliquescent powder. In air, it easily hydrolyses to release hydrogen sulfide (rotten egg odor).
Lithium sulfide is prepared by treating lithium with sulfur. This reaction is conveniently conducted in anhydrous ammonia.
2 Li + S → Li2S
The THF-soluble triethylborane adduct of lithium sulfide can be generated using superhydride.
Lithium sulfide has been considered for use in lithium-sulfur batteries.
