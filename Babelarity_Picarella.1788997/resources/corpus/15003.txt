Qu Yunxia (simplified Chinese: 曲云霞; traditional Chinese: 曲雲霞; pinyin: Qǔ Yúnxiá; born 25 December 1972) is a Chinese Olympic athlete who specialized in the 1500 metres.
At the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona she won a bronze medal in 1500 m.
On 9 November 1993 she set the world record in the 1500 metres at 3:50.46 minutes while running in the National Games of China in Beijing. The record stood 22 years, until broken on 17 July 2015, by Genzebe Dibaba who was the only non-Chinese athlete to seriously challenge the mark during that period.
She won the 3000 metres at the 1993 World Championships in Athletics setting what will likely be the permanent Championship Record in the event. In 1995 and since, women switched to running 5,000 metres.
