For the group of theropod dinosaurs, see Coelurosauria.
Coelurosauravus (meaning "hollow lizard grandfather") is a genus of basal diapsid reptile, with specialized wing-like structures allowing it to glide. These were rod like structures with skin stretched over them. These bony rods are not extensions of the ribs but are newly evolved dermal bones, a feature which is unique to the genus.
The average length of the specimens was 40 centimetres (16 in) and the body was long and flat, suitable for gliding. The skull was lizard-like with a pointed snout and contained a broad back with a serrated crest, superficially resembling the crests of ceratopsian dinosaurs. It lived during the Upper Permian (Lopingian) period in what is now Germany, England and Madagascar.
Daedalosaurus Carroll, 1978, based on a specimen from the Late Permian of Madagascar, is a synonym. Gracilisaurus and Weigeltisaurus, both from the Late Permian of northeastern Germany, were synonymized with Coelurosauravus in 1987.
A Coelurosauravus features strongly in the science fiction show Primeval. A male Coelurosauravus, later named "Rex", enters the present through a time anomaly and, despite attempts to send it back to the Permian, quickly becomes a mascot for the team featured in the series. Coelurosauravus is incorrectly shown to be capable of powered flight rather than simple gliding, and far larger than its real size of 40 cm. In addition it is shown with a retractable head crest, which is entirely speculative.
