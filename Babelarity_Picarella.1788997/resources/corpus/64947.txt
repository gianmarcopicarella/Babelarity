In mathematics, a self-similar object is exactly or approximately similar to a part of itself (i.e. the whole has the same shape as one or more of the parts). Many objects in the real world, such as coastlines, are statistically self-similar: parts of them show the same statistical properties at many scales. Self-similarity is a typical property of fractals. Scale invariance is an exact form of self-similarity where at any magnification there is a smaller piece of the object that is similar to the whole. For instance, a side of the Koch snowflake is both symmetrical and scale-invariant; it can be continually magnified 3x without changing shape. The non-trivial similarity evident in fractals is distinguished by their fine structure, or detail on arbitrarily small scales. As a counterexample, whereas any portion of a straight line may resemble the whole, further detail is not revealed.
In mathematics, self-affinity refers to a fractal whose pieces are scaled by different amounts in the x- and y-directions. This means that to appreciate the self similarity of these fractal objects, they have to be rescaled using an anisotropic affine transformation.
A compact topological space X is self-similar if there exists a finite set S indexing a set of non-surjective homeomorphisms 
        {
          f
            s
        :
        s
        ∈
        S
        }
    {\displaystyle \{f_{s}:s\in S\}}
   for which
        X
        =
          ⋃
            s
            ∈
            S
          f
            s
        (
        X
        )
    {\displaystyle X=\bigcup _{s\in S}f_{s}(X)}
If 
        X
        ⊂
        Y
    {\displaystyle X\subset Y}
  , we call X self-similar if it is the only non-empty subset of Y such that the equation above holds for 
        {
          f
            s
        :
        s
        ∈
        S
        }
    {\displaystyle \{f_{s}:s\in S\}}
  . We call
            L
        =
        (
        X
        ,
        S
        ,
        {
          f
            s
        :
        s
        ∈
        S
        }
        )
    {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {L}}=(X,S,\{f_{s}:s\in S\})}
a self-similar structure. The homeomorphisms may be iterated, resulting in an iterated function system. The composition of functions creates the algebraic structure of a monoid. When the set S has only two elements, the monoid is known as the dyadic monoid. The dyadic monoid can be visualized as an infinite binary tree; more generally, if the set S has p elements, then the monoid may be represented as a p-adic tree.
The automorphisms of the dyadic monoid is the modular group; the automorphisms can be pictured as hyperbolic rotations of the binary tree.
A more general notion than self-similarity is Self-affinity.
The Mandelbrot set is also self-similar around Misiurewicz points.
Self-similarity has important consequences for the design of computer networks, as typical network traffic has self-similar properties. For example, in teletraffic engineering, packet switched data traffic patterns seem to be statistically self-similar. This property means that simple models using a Poisson distribution are inaccurate, and networks designed without taking self-similarity into account are likely to function in unexpected ways.
Similarly, stock market movements are described as displaying self-affinity, i.e. they appear self-similar when transformed via an appropriate affine transformation for the level of detail being shown. Andrew Lo describes stock market log return self-similarity in econometrics.
Finite subdivision rules are a powerful technique for building self-similar sets, including the Cantor set and the Sierpinski triangle.
Self-similarity can be found in nature, as well. To the right is a mathematically generated, perfectly self-similar image of a fern, which bears a marked resemblance to natural ferns. Other plants, such as Romanesco broccoli, exhibit strong self-similarity.
Strict canons display various types and amounts of self similarity, as do sections of fugues.
A Shepard tone is self-similar in the frequency or wavelength domains.
The Danish composer Per Nørgård has made use of a self-similar integer sequence named the 'infinity series' in much of his music.
