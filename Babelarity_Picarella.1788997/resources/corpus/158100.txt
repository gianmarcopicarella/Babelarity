In 1914 it was elevated to a district with the name São Sebastião do Ribeirão. With the transfer of the new capital in 1935 it was dismembered from Trindade and made part of Goiânia. In 1938 the name was changed to Ribeirão. In 1943 the name was changed again to Guapó and it became a municipality. "Guapó" is of Tupi origin and means "eater of roots".
