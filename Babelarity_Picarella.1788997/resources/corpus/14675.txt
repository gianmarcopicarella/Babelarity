The men's +80 kg competition at the 2012 Summer Olympics was held on 11 August, at the ExCeL Exhibition Centre.
The main bracket consisted of a single elimination tournament, culminating in the gold medal match. Two bronze medals were awarded at the Taekwondo competitions. A repechage was used to determine the bronze medal winners. Every competitor who lost to one of the two finalists competed in the repechage, another single-elimination competition. Each semifinal loser faced the last remaining repechage competitor from the opposite half of the bracket in a bronze medal match.
All times are British Summer Time (UTC+1)
