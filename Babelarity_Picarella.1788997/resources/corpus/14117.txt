Cho Won-hee (Hangul: 조원희, born 17 April 1983) is a South Korean footballer who plays for Suwon Samsung Bluewings as a midfielder.
As a child, Cho often played as a forward. Later, when he was picked for South Korean U20 squad, he also played as a left winger. In 2001, Cho was planning to play football at university as many other Korean footballers do, but he failed to do so, so he signed with Ulsan Hyundai, one of the most successful clubs in the K-League. In 2003, Cho decided to join Gwangju Sangmu Phoenix, the army team to finish his army duty and to play first team football. There, he was quite impressive, and after his 2-year-duty at Gwangju, he moved to Suwon Samsung Bluewings, a team that was nicknamed "Real Suwon" for its cash-splashing signings. He originally played as a right wingback or right fullback at the Big Bird Stadium, competing for regular with Song Chong-Gug, but in 2007, after a long-term injury of defensive midfielder Kim Nam-Il, he changed his position to defensive midfielder. Throughout the 2007 season, he was not very impressive, and many fans were especially concerned with his rough passing. However, next season, he showed his quality with improved passing and sight, and became a first team regular. After lifting the league trophy with Suwon, he became free agent.
Cho was linked with several European clubs, including German giant Schalke 04 and French side AS Monaco. After trialing with AS Monaco in January 2009, Cho sought another trial with Wigan Athletic after it was revealed that AS Monaco had all of their non-EU player slots filled. He impressed during a trial with the club, and after being granted a work permit, Cho was allowed to join Wigan Athletic on 6 March 2009 with 2 years 6 months contract. Cho played his first reserve game in a 2–2 draw against Liverpool reserves, notching an assist. Cho received a calf injury in a friendly against Iraq where he was kicked in the leg.  He nearly missed the remainder of the season, but managed to fully recover so as to make his Premier League debut for Wigan in the final match of the 2008–09 season against Stoke City. So far, Cho has made one appearance as a starter and four as a substitute. He scored a beautiful goal against Norwich City in a pre-season friendly at Carrow Road.
He joined Suwon Bluewings on a one-year loan in January 2010. He returned to Wigan Athletic after his loan expired.
On 13 February 2011, Cho joined Chinese Super League side Guangzhou Evergrande on a free transfer, which made him the second Korean player to play for Guangzhou F.C. after Park Ji-Ho. He was the only player to appear in all 30 Super League games for Guangzhou in the 2011 season. On 30 May 2012, Cho suffered a rib fracture in the Round of 16 of 2012 AFC Champions League which Guangzhou Evergrande beat F.C. Tokyo 1–0. He lost his position to Kim Young-Gwon and was replaced by Kim in the 30-man squad which was submitted for the next stage of the Champions League after Kim transferred to Guangzhou in August. He won the league in the 2011 and 2012 season for Guangzhou Evergrande.
On 28 November 2012, Wuhan Zall officially announced they had signed Cho on a free transfer.
On February 2014, Cho was loaned to Gyeongnam FC
On 4 July 2014, Cho moved to Omiya Ardija to the end of the season.
On 5 February 2015, Cho signed for a new team Seoul E-Land FC.
Cho scored his first international goal in his debut game against Iran on 12 October 2005. His shot deflected off an opposing defender and became one of the few goals scored within a minute. This goal is guessed to be the fastest goal South Korean National Team has ever scored, if the unrecorded games in the 50s and the 60s are not counted. Although Cho impressed as a right-back in his first game, he did not make an appearance in the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
