Handball at the 1984 Summer Olympics featured competition for men and women. Due to the USSR-led boycott some strong handball nations from Eastern Bloc did not compete; this gave an opportunity to the Yugoslav team to take both gold medals.
Teams in two groups played each other in a round to decide, for which place each of them should compete in the Final Round.
1st-placed teams from each group competed for the 1st place in this round;
2nd-placed - competed for the 3rd place
3rd-placed - competed for the 5th place
4th-placed - competed for the 7th place
5th-placed - competed for the 9th place
6th-placed - competed for the 11th place
All matches were held on August 10.
