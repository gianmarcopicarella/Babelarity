An Acoustic Night at the Theatre is the second live album by Dutch symphonic metal band Within Temptation that has been released in October–November 2009.
The album is made up of the acoustic set at Eindhoven's Muziekcentrum Frits Philips, from the band's Theatre Tour in November 2008. It also includes a new studio recording, "Utopia", a duet with Chris Jones, which was released as a single on October 23, 2009. Drummer Mike Coolen performed on the acoustic set: he later became the band's full-time drummer, replacing Stephen van Haestregt who moved on to new band My Favorite Scar.
