Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku (私立恵比寿中学, Shiritsu Ebisu Chūgaku, lit. "Ebisu Private Junior High School") is a Japanese girl idol group. The band's name is officially shortened to Ebichu (エビ中), which is a double entendre that can mean "in a shrimp". The group was created by 3B Junior, the third section of the talent agency Stardust Promotion. Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku is a "little sister" group to another Stardust Promotion girl group, Momoiro Clover Z.
Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku is named after a fictitious school in Ebisu, a neighbourhood in Shibuya, Tokyo. It was planned as a group of elementary and middle school students. The band was officially nicknamed "King of School Play", and its concept was advertised as being a group with very rough singing and dancing skills. Or, more accurately, the band's slogan is "Unarticulated dance and shaky vocals." Ebichu was formed as a quintet on August 4, 2009. At present, there are eight members. The only original member who is still in the group is Rika Mayama. Although in April 2012 they both entered high school, it was decided that they would remain in the group. They joke that they are middle school students forever.
In June 2011, it was announced that Ebichu was to hold its first solo concert, on October 8 at Shibuya O-East. Parts of it were released on the band's first solo live DVD, which appeared on February 15 of the next year. In total, in October Shiritsu Ebisu Chūgaku gave three sold-out performances. After six self-published "indie" singles on the talent agency's recording label, the latest few of which charted on Oricon, the group signed a temporary contract with the major label Defstar Records to release a single titled, incidentally, "Karikeiyaku no Cinderella" ("Temporary Contract Cinderella"). The release date had already been determined as May 5, 2012, the Children's Day. The contract signing was made into a ceremony, which was held on March 4 in the presence of a large audience of fans. The single "Karikeiyaku no Cinderella" debuted at number 7 in the Oricon daily ranking for May 1. Having peaked in the daily chart at second position, it also debuted at number 7 in the Oricon Weekly Singles Chart.
On June 25, 2012, Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku took part in Yubi Matsuri, an idol festival produced by Rino Sashihara from AKB48. The concert was held at Nippon Budokan before a crowd of 8,000 people and featured such girl groups as Idoling!!!, Super Girls, Tokyo Girls' Style, Nogizaka46, Passpo, Buono!, Momoiro Clover Z, and Watarirouka Hashiritai 7.
On July 1, 2012, Ebichu held a three and a half hour solo concert at Nippon Seinenkan, their first solo concert at the venue. The show was called "Jā Best Ten" and featured an imaginary ranking of the band's songs, counted down in the style of 1980s TV shows. It also included the first public performance of the song "Go! Go! Here We Go! Rock Lee", a closing theme of the anime Naruto SD, to be released as the group's second single in August.
The girls declared that they were aiming for third place in the Oricon chart with their third single, titled "Ume". The goal was achieved — the single actually placed 3rd in the weekly chart.
It was announced that the 3 members Mizuki, Natsu Annno and Hirono Suzuki will leave the group in a concert, held on April 15, 2014 at the Nippon Budokan. After leaving, they will study to enter universities and get trained to be actresses. Especially Natsu Anno will study abroad, and not return to Japan for a long time.
In the middle of December 2015 it was announced that Hinata Kashiwagi had been diagnozed with sudden deafness and that the release of the group's third album, scheduled for release on 10 February 2016, had been postponed for an indefinite period of time.
The members are assigned so-called attendance numbers, just like in Japanese schools. Initially the numbers were given in the order of joining the group, but once, when several members left, the remaining members held an election to reassign their numbers.
