Niklas Moisander (born 29 September 1985) is a Finnish footballer who plays as a centre back for Werder Bremen, and for the Finland national team. Moisander was born in Turku, Finland where he played for the local TPS youth team before moving to Ajax´s junior organisation. He is the twin brother of goalkeeper Henrik Moisander, and is the current captain of the national team of Finland. He was voted the Finnish Footballer of the Year in both 2012 and 2013.
Moisander started his football career together with his twin brother Henrik, both joining local Turun Palloseura from their home town of Turku in 2001. A year later he made his debut in the Veikkausliiga, the premier division of Football in Finland under then manager Mika Laurikainen. He was selected in the starting lineup on 15 May 2003 in a regular season's fixture against cross town rivals Inter Turku. He played the full 90 minutes in the 0–2 away win in his first Turku derby match. He went on to make 17 appearances for TPS during the 2002 and 2003 seasons, becoming a regular with his home club at the age of 17.
On 5 June 2003 it was announced that Ajax had signed the twins Henrik and Niklas to a two-year contract binding them to the club until the summer of 2005. At Ajax they would join the team where both Finland Internationals Jari Litmanen and Petri Pasanen were playing at the time. At first instance the twins were to join the under-19 team of Ajax A1, competing in the 2003–04 A-junioren Eredivisie league in their first year with the club. The twins helped their side secure the club's eighth A-Juniors league title, under the tutelage and guidance of then coach Danny Blind. The following season saw Moisander and his brother compete in the Beloften Eredivisie for the team's reserve squad Jong Ajax, where they would help to win the reserve league title in their first year on the team. Signing a contract extension for an additional year by the end of the season, Ajax eventually won the KNVB Cup in conclusion. Unable to break into the first team, however, after their second term with the reserves, the twins were separated. While Henrik was dispatched to Assyriska in Sweden, Niklas remained in the Netherlands, where he signed with FC Zwolle instead.
On 3 May 2006 it was announced that Moisander would transfer to the Eerste Divisie side FC Zwolle, signing a two-year contract with the club from Overijssel.

Moisander quickly came back to help his side win the Eredivisie league title, the second for the club in its history and Moisander's personal first. That season the title race had come down to the final round, and although AZ had lost their last game of the season against Vitesse Arnhem, they were still able to consequently clinch the league due to eminent losses suffered by title contenders Ajax and Twente. The following season Moisander made his continental debut playing in the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League group stage campaign. Playing in 5 out of the 6 matches against the likes of Arsenal, Olympiacos and Standard Liège AZ finished in the bottom of the group, under newly appointed manager Ronald Koeman. This was after having won the Dutch Super Cup (Johan Cruijff Schaal) against SC Heerenveen at the start of the season. Midway through the season the team changed management again when Dick Advocaat was hired as a replacement for Ronald Koeman, and the club finishing the season in fifth place and thus qualifying for the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League Third qualifying round.
Ahead of the 2010–11 season, AZ had found another replacement in Gertjan Verbeek as the new manager. Moisander played a major role in helping his side to qualify for the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League group stage, having appeared in all four games in the qualifying rounds. He also played in 4 of the 6 group stage encounters against Dynamo Kyiv, BATE Borisov and Sheriff Tiraspol. The team however finished the league in fourth place thus qualifying for the qualifying rounds once more.

Securing the group stage of the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League once more, through a successful qualifying campaign against Baumit Jablonec and Aalesunds, his team would then successfully advance out of the group stage where they faced off with the likes of Austria Wien, Malmö FF and Metalist Kharkiv, finishing in second place of the group. They then advanced to the quarter-finals of the competition by defeating Anderlecht and Udinese in previous rounds, eventually bowing out to Valencia 5–2 on aggregate score. Moisander played in 14 matches during the clubs continental campaign, when they reached the quarter-finals of the competition for the fourth time in the club's history. Moisander started the 2012–13 Eredivisie season with AZ, making two league appearances, before transferring back to neighboring Ajax Amsterdam.

He was voted Finnish Footballer of the Year by both the Football Association of Finland and the Finnish Sports’ Journalists Association, as Ajax went on to win their 32nd league title in his first year back with the club.
Following an injury to Siem de Jong the following season, and after the departure of vice-captain, fellow centre back Toby Alderweireld to Atlético Madrid, Moisander wore the captain's armband for the first time for Ajax in an away match against FC Groningen on 1 September 2013. He played his 50th official match for Ajax on 22 September in the Topper match against rivals PSV which ended in a 4–0 loss for Ajax.

He permanently solidified his position in the team after Baxter brought him in, in the final 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying group stage match against Russia.
