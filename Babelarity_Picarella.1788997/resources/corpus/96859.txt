Europa Universalis is a grand strategy video game developed by Paradox Development Studio and published by Strategy First. The game was originally based on a French board game of the same name by Philippe Thibaut, and was released on February 20, 2001. Europa Universalis lets the player take control of one of seven European nations (others are available in different scenarios) from 1492 to 1792, expanding its power through military might, diplomacy, and colonial wealth. The game takes place on a map divided into approximately 1,500 provinces, and proceeds in a pausable real time format.
The game became a surprise hit for its great deal of depth and strategy. Paradox used this sudden success to springboard other titles such as Victoria, Crusader Kings, and Hearts of Iron.
Europa Universalis was the first in the series, followed by Europa Universalis II, Europa Universalis III, Europa Universalis: Rome and Europa Universalis IV
