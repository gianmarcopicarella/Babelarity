Pierre Dupong (1 November 1885 – 23 December 1953) was a Luxembourgish politician and statesman. He was the 16th Prime Minister of Luxembourg, serving for sixteen years, from 11 May 1937 until his death, on 23 December 1953, and was also responsible at different times for the ministries of finance, the army, agriculture, labour and social matters. He founded the Christian Social People's Party (CSV) as the main conservative party after the Second World War, having been a founding member of the Party of the Right (PD) in 1914.
He was one of the founding members in 1914 of the Party of the Right, and was elected to the legislature in 1915. From 1926 he was 1937 Director-General for Finance, and in 1936 and 1937 also Minister for Social Security and Labor.
His first government was the Dupong-Krier Ministry (1937–1940). Between 1940 and 1944, Dupong then led the Luxembourgish government-in-exile, after Luxembourg had been occupied by Nazi Germany. He then presided over the Liberation Government, the National Union Government, and the Dupong-Schaus and the Dupong-Bodson governments. He is also notable for sending Luxembourgish soldiers in the UN mission during the Korean War, as part of the Belgian United Nations Command.
He was the father of Jean Dupong, who became a minister and CSV deputy himself.
