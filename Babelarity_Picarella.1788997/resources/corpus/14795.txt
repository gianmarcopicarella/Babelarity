Francisco Javier González Pérez (Spanish pronunciation: [fɾanˈθisko ˈxaβjer ɣonˈθaleθ ˈpeɾeθ]; born 14 July 1969), known as Fran [fɾan], is a Spanish retired professional footballer.
He spent his entire career with Deportivo, as a left midfielder with skill and field vision, helping it win the first La Liga title in the club's history.
Fran represented Spain at Euro 2000.
Fran, one of the most notable players in Deportivo de La Coruña's history, was born in Carreira, Santa Uxía de Ribeira, Galicia, and arrived at the club's first team in 1988, making his La Liga debut on 31 August 1991 in a 1–2 away loss against Valencia CF. Quickly established, he only missed eight league games in his first five seasons combined – also scoring on 24 occasions – while already being team captain.
In the 1995–96 off-season Real Madrid almost signed Fran, but he regretted leaving Deportivo and returned quickly. In 1999–2000, as Depor conquered its first top level league, injuries limited him to only 22 games, and he added a goal in a 2–0 home win over Valencia on 12 March 2000.
Fran retired from football at the end of the 2004–05 campaign after 17 years with his only club, 14 in the first division, at the same time as Mauro Silva, with both playing their last match on 22 May 2005 in a 0–3 home defeat to RCD Mallorca. He amassed more than 600 overall appearances.
In 2008 Fran returned to Deportivo, joining its indoor football team, alongside club greats Djalminha, Donato, Noureddine Naybet and Jacques Songo'o.
Fran made his Spanish national team debut on 27 January 1993, in a friendly 1–1 draw against Mexico in Las Palmas. In total he earned 16 caps, participating at UEFA Euro 2000 where he played his last international, in a 4–3 group stage win over Yugoslavia.
Fran's older brother, José Ramón, was also a footballer (and a midfielder). He too spent several seasons with Deportivo, but with much less individual impact.
