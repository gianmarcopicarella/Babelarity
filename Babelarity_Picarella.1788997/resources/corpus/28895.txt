Montcornet is a commune in the Aisne department in Picardy in northern France.
On 14 May 1940, Charles de Gaulle was given command of the new 4e Division cuirass√©e and ordered to execute a counterattack toward Montcornet, with the objective of slowing the German advance. This was one of the only counterattacks of the French campaign that succeeded in repulsing the German troops.
