Crossobamon is a genus of lizards of the gecko family Gekkonidae.
The genus Crossobamon contains two species:
Crossobamon eversmanni (Wiegmann, 1834)
Crossobamon orientalis (Blanford, 1876)
The latter species is poorly described, and was formerly considered a member of the genus Stenodactylus.
The specific name, eversmanni, is in honor of German-born Russian biologist Alexander Eduard Friedrich Eversmann.
Geckos of the genus Crossobamon live in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Russia, and Central Asia.
Of average size for geckos, about 16 cm (6.3 in) long, the two species are similar in appearance.
